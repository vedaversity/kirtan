    "en": `Nitai and Caitanya are exalted avataras. No one is merciful like Them.

How many hundreds of mlecchas, candalas, blasphemers, and offenders did They deliver?

Why does the descent of Nitai and Caitanya to this world mean nothing to me? Alas! My heart is very cruel. How can I live a happy life?

Many many avataras have come to this world. O my brothers, none of Them are like these avataras.

I did not worship those two Lords. Raising my hand to my mouth, I have drunk poison.

The whole world is plunged into the nectar of kirtana brought by Lord Gaura. Alas! Not even a drop of that nectar has touched this unfortunate soul.

With his own hands Krishna dasa pulls the hairs from his head. Alas! Alas! I am very unfortunate! Why do I not die?`
