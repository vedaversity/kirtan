    "en": `O You who take shelter of the round breasts of Kamala, O You whose ears are decorated with earrings and who wears an enchanting garland of forest flowers, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O ornament of the sun globe, O You who severs the bondage of material existence, O swan who sports in the [lake of the] sages’ minds, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O You who pulverize the pride of the venomous snake Kāliya, O You who delight the people [of Vraja], O sun that makes the lotus of the Yadu dynasty bloom, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O destroyer of the demons Madhu, Mura, and Naraka, O You who ride upon Garuḍa and who inspire the demigods’ delightful play, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O You whose wide eyes resemble the petals of an immaculate lotus, O You who bestow emancipation from material existence and who are the foundation of the three worlds, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O You who are decorated by the daughter of King Janaka (Sītā-devī), O You who defeated the demon Dūṣaṇa and killed the ten-headed Rāvaṇa in battle, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O You whose complexion is lustrous like a fresh raincloud, O You who hold the Mandara Mountain and who are the cakora bird incessantly attached to the moonlike face of Śrī Rādhā, O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

O Lord, we have taken exclusive refuge at Your lotus feet. Please bestow auspiciousness upon Your surrendered servants [by blessing us with prema-bhakti], O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!

May this radiant and auspicious song composed by Śrī Jayadeva increase happiness [for You and for Your devotees who hear and recite it], O Deva, O Hari, may You be triumphant!`
