    "en": `O Hari! Initiated or not, if one free from bad association sings Your name, I will mentally honor him, knowing him to be a kindred soul.

To one who is initiated and serves Your feet, I will offer my obeisance. And to one experienced in one-pointed bhajana, I will serve, O Hari!

I consider it my fortune to have received the darśana of that devotee who is equipoised in regard to all living beings. I know that having obtained his association, I have become successful.

When will I achieve the virtue of being sincere in my attitude toward the Vaiṣṇavas? Oh, when will I cross over this ocean of worldly existence and reach Your abode of Vraja?`
