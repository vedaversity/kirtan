    "en": `All glories, all glories to you, our divine master, Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja, whose supremely charming form delivers all suffering souls.

You are the very embodiment of Vedānta and the annihilator of everything inauspicious. “Śrī Vedānta is a scripture of bhakti.” This is your bold declaration.

Upon the lamp of the Śrī Gauḓīya Vedānta Samiti is the splendid light of siddhānta. With that lamp, your ārati is perpetually performed.

The lamp is filled with the oil of the current [of the conceptions] flowing from Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. The ten directions are sweetly aromatized by the incense [of the moods] of the followers of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

Your beautiful lotus face is simultaneously grave, due to your profound realization of all the scriptures, and soft, by virtue of your deep compassion.

Your beautiful bodily limbs vanquish the effulgence of molten gold. By your wearing the garments of a renunciant, the welfare of the universe is achieved.

Śrī Sajjana  fans you with a cāmara, using various artistic styles, while Śrī Gaura-nārāyaṇa  sings very sweetly in a loud voice.

As the devotees perform this immensely auspicious ārati, the foolish Trivikrama watches from afar.`
