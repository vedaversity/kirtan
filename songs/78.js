    "en": `Her body is engaged in wiping away glistening drops of perspira­tion from the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava. In superlative sauhlāda-rasa, she always remains independent. I offer praṇāma unto the audacious Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of (beauty, sweetness, gravity, and various other) charming qualities.

Her beautiful face mocks the brilliance of the full moon. Her lovely eyes are (ever restless,) like those of a startled doe. She is renowned for her extraordinary expertise in the art of dressing Śrīmatī Rādhikā. I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

Her silk dress is as beautiful as the wonderfully multicolored feathers of an ecstatically dancing peacock. Her body is nicely adorned with various kinds of jeweled ornaments and a bodice. Her golden complexion defeats the lustre of gorocanā  . I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

“O Kalaṅkinī (unchaste one) ! Rādhike! Vrajendra-nandana is very cunning, so be firm in Your contrariness. Don’t give into gentle submission. Rādhe, listen to these beneficial words.” In this way, she gives instructions. I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

Upon hearing Vrajendra-nandana speak even a few crafty words to Śrīmatī Rādhikā, her eyes become red [with fury], and she immediately shames Him with sarcastic words (such as, “You are so truthful, simple-hearted, and such a chaste lover !”). I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

She is the resting place of the vātsalya-rasa of goparāja Nanda’s queen, Śrī Yaśodā-devī. As the instructing guru of all the sakhīs, she teaches them the art of friendship. She is the very life of Śrīmatī Rādhikā and of the younger brother of Baladeva. [Alternately: Śrīmatī Rādhikā and the younger brother of Baladeva are her very life.] I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

Upon seeing any young maiden anywhere in Vraja and discerning that she is inclined toward (her priya-sakhī ) Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī Śrīmatī Rādhikā, Lalitā immediately fulfills all of that maiden’s internal desires and makes her life successful. I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

Her primary engagement is providing pleasure to Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda by arranging Their meetings, which she considers to be the best of all festivals. She is the foremost among all priya-sakhīs of Gokula. I offer praṇāma unto Lalitā-devī, who is a repository of charming qualities.

One who, with a cheerful and pure heart, recites these eight verses in praise of Lalitā-devī, which are extremely beautiful due to their description of her charming qualities, is affectionately drawn to Śrīmatī Rādhikā—the brilliant wish-fulfilling creeper of the dynasty of Kīrtidā-devī's husband, Śrī Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja—and enters Her own group of sakhīs (who She counts among Her very own).`
