dehete pulaka,    udita haibe,
premete karibe bhora

gada-gada vāṇī,    mukhe bāhiribe,
kā̐pibe śarīra mama
gharma muhurmuhuḥ,    vivarṇa haibe,
stambhita pralaẏa sama

āveśe rahiẏā,    dehayātrā kari’,
tomāra karuṇā pā’ba`,

    "en": `O Gurudeva! When will that day be mine? Making my mind steady and sitting in a solitary place, I will sing Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s names. At that time, worldly topics will not enter my ears and the diseases of the body will remain far away.

While chanting “Hare Kṛṣṇa,” tears will flow from my eyes, the hair of my body will stand on end, and I shall become overwhelmed with prema.

The words from my mouth will become choked. My body will tremble, perspire repeatedly and turn pale in color, and I will become stunned as if devastated.

When shall I attain such a sincere state that I will continuously sing the holy names? At that time, remaining absorbed in ecstasy and doing only what is necessary to maintain my body, I shall receive your mercy.`
