śuna bhāi, hai͌yā ekamana
āśraẏa laiẏā bhaje,    tāre kṛṣṇa nāhi tyaje,

vaiṣṇava-caraṇa-jala,    prema-bhakti dite bala,
āra keha nahe balavanta
vaiṣṇava-caraṇa-reṇu,    mastake bhūṣaṇa vinu,
āra nāhi bhūṣaṇera anta

tīrthajala pavitra guṇe,    likhiẏāche purāṇe,
se-saba bhaktira pravañcana
vaiṣṇavera pādodaka-    sama nahe ei saba,
ʝāte haẏa vāñchita-pūraṇa

vaiṣṇava-saṅgete mana,    ānandita anukṣaṇa,
sadā haẏa kṛṣṇa-parasaṅga
dīna narottama kānde,    hiẏā dhairya nāhi bāndhe,
mora daśā kena haila bhaṅga`,

    "en": `The lotus feet of the venerable Vaiṣṇavas are the greatest treasure in the world. O brother, please listen with rapt attention. Śrī Kṛṣṇa never forsakes one who, having taken shelter of the Vaiṣṇavas, lovingly worships Him. All others perish without purpose.

There is nothing more powerful than water that has washed the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava, to give the strength to attain prema-bhakti. There is no greater ornament than the dust of the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava to serve as the ornament for one’s head.

The purifying qualities of water from holy places are written in the Purāṇas, but all this cheats one of [the wealth of] bhakti. Actually, the water from holy places is not as purifying as water that has washed the feet of Vaiṣṇavas, by which one’s desires are fulfilled.

The heart feels joyful at every moment in the company of Vaiṣṇavas, where topics of Kṛṣṇa are always discussed. With a restless heart, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura cries, “Why have I been torn from their association?”`
