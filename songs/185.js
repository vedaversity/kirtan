    "en": `That person for whom the two lotus feet of Śrī Gaurāṅga are his wealth and property knows the essence of bhakti-rasa. That person for whom the sweet pastimes of Gaurāṅga have entered the ears is pure in heart.

Within one who takes Gaurāṅga’s holy names, prema arises. I heartily glorify such a person. To one whose eyes stream tears in appreciation of Gaurāṅga’s transcendental qualities, the Divine Couple’s eternal pastimes become manifest. Such a person is qualified for bhakti.

One who reveres Gaurāṅga’s personal associates as eternally perfected souls goes to the transcendental abode of Vrajendra-suta (the son of the king of Vraja). One who knows the land of Śrī Gauḓa-maṇḍala to be spiritual touchstone achieves residence in the land of Vraja.

One who dives into the waves of the ocean of gaura-prema becomes a confidential associate of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava. Whether a person lives in his home as a householder or in the forest as a renunciant, if he exclaims, “Hā Gaurāṅga!” Narottama dāsa begs for his association.`
