    "en": `Night is over, and the light [of dawn] is coming. Arise, O jīva, and give up your sleep! Chant the names of Hari, Mukunda, Murāri, Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, and Hayagrīva!

[Chant] Nṛsimha, Vāmana, Śrī Madhusūdana, Vrajendra-nandana, and Śyāma—the killer of Pūtanā and the destroyer of Kaiṭabha. All glories to the son of King Daśaratha, Lord Rāma!

He is the darling son of Yaśodā and the protector and maintainer of the cows, their pastures, the gopas, and the gopīs. He is the king of Vṛndāvana, the dearmost beloved of the gopīs, and the consort of Śrīmatī Rādhikā. In the entire world, His beauty is unsurpassed.

He is the killer of Rāvaṇa, the butter thief, the stealer of the young gopīs’ garments, the protector of the cows of Vraja, the guardian of the gopas, and the flute player who enchants the minds of all.

He is the object of great yogīs’ worship, the beautiful son of Nanda, and the remover of fear from the residents of Vraja. His form, which is like a fresh rain cloud, enchants the mind, and He captivates all with His artistry in flute-playing.

He is the darling son of Yaśodā, the heroic killer of Kaṁsa, the performer of nectarean pastimes in the pleasure-groves of Vraja, the enjoyer of the rāsa dance in the arena of the kadamba forest, and the resident of Vṛndāvana Forest.

He is the enhancer of bliss and the abode of prema. He is the transcendental Cupid who aims His flower arrows [at the gopīs, by which He increases transcendental desires in them]. He gives pleasure to the hearts of the gopīs, and He is the abode of all good qualities.

He is the life and soul of Yamunā, He is absorbed in amorous pastimes, and He is the cakora bird who subsists on the rays emanating from the moon of Śrī Rādhā's mind. O mind, always heed my words and sing Kṛṣṇa’s glories in the form of these holy names, which are full of nectar.`
