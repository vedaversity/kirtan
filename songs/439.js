    "en": `O wicked mind! What kind of Vaisnava are you? Your chanting, [which you perform] in a solitary place for the sake of prestige, is solely pretense.

Worldly fame is the excrement of hogs. Do you not know that it is the wealth of māyā? What is the use of fixating day and night on wealth and women, when all these are temporary?

Your wealth is a source of sense enjoyment; use it to serve Mādhava, the husband of Lakṣmī-devī. Fulfilling the desires of women is not your domain, for their sole master is Śrī Yādava. [He alone can fully satisfy their desires.] The tree of the desire for prestige is like the mirage in the desert that Rāvaṇa was unable to attain by fighting Śrī Rāghava (Rāmācandra).

Be steadfast in [your acceptance of] the prestige that comes from being a Vaiṣṇava. If you do not observe this, then you will go to [the hellish planet known as] Raurava. Envying the devotees of Śrī Hari is an affliction arising from your desire for prestige, so why do you see so much glory in that prestige?

The spiritual fame that follows the Vaiṣṇavas is never to be considered a temporary material glory, for it occurs in relation­ship to Śrī Hari and is devoid of the stench of māyā. In it, there is never any mundane duplicity.

Know that the dog-eating outcaste woman of worldly prestige and the snare of solitude [that is, solitary bhajana] are both illusory hells. “I shall give up kīrtana and smear myself with worldly honor [by performing solitary bhajana]”—what is the use of seeking such “glory”?

Always know that Mādhavendra Purī never stole [that is, he never falsely displayed] the symptoms of bhāva. Your fame is the excrement of hogs; never consider it to be equivalent to his.

Under the control of envy, you have drowned yourself in mundane rasa by renouncing the sublime beauty of kīrtana. There­fore, O wicked mind, you fraudulently propagate solitary bhajana, which is the [useless] wealth of a false renunciate.

You should meditate upon all that Śrīman Mahaprabhu taught with great care to Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. Never forget the following two instructions: (1) chant the holy names of Śrī Hari in a loud voice and (2) never consider phalgu- and yukta-vairagya (false and appropriate renunciation) to be the same, and never consider baddha- and mukta-jīvas (bound and liberated souls) to be the same.

That person whom wealth, women, and the tigress of prestige have given up is indeed a Vaiṣṇava.  Such a person is a detached, pure devotee before whom material existence accepts defeat.

Where only those sense objects necessary to maintain the body are accepted, there is no disease [or pitfall]. What else can be said about such detachment? When free from attachment, one sees all objects of enjoyment in connection with Mādhava.

This is appropriate renunciation, and great fortune is found there. Indeed, in the material realm, the wealth of Śrī Hari is found therein. However, the glory of one who performs kīrtana to enhance his reputation is merely fraudulent.

Give up both the desire of renouncing worldly objects and craving for mundane pleasure, O mind, for both are unbefitting a Vaiṣṇava. Connection [of these two propensities] with Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the source of transcendence. That [connection] is never possible for materialists.

The hearts of those who accept the philosophy of impersonalism are directed away from Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Arrogant about their liberation, they blaspheme the Vaiṣṇavas. Your aspiration for bhakti depends on service to the Vaiṣṇavas, so why have you invited this struggle with solitude?

A false renunciate who calls himself an ascetic can never become a Vaiṣṇava. By giving up the lotus feet of Śrī Hari and increasing his solitude, the glory of whatever result he obtains is simply a sham.

Becoming situated in rādhā-dāsya (the service of Śrī Rādhā), release yourself from the serpent of material enjoyment. Know that the desire for respect and adoration is not the glory of kīrtana. O mind, having given up the association of Śrī Rādhā’s eternal servants, why have you adopted the fraudulent practice of solitary bhajana?

The residents of Vraja are the true preachers and wealth [of the Lord]. They are not beggars of worldly fame, who are like corpses. Indeed, because they are infused with life, they propagate the narrations of Śrī Kṛṣṇa everywhere, devoid of any desire for prestige.

Śrī Dayita dāsa places all his hopes in kīrtana. [O mind,] chant the names of Śrī Hari in a loud voice, because through the potency of kīrtana, remembrance of the Lord will arise.  Only at that time will solitary bhajana be possible.`
