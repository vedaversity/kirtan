    "en": `The beloved daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja is the crest-jewel of all beautiful young maidens. She wears blue-colored garments. Defeating the beauty of cut gold, Her complexion shines attractively. Her hair is beautifully plaited. She is the life and soul of Hari.

She is adorned with beautiful ornaments, She is expert in amorous affairs with Śrī Hari, and Her forehead is gracefully decorated with tilaka. Her breasts are covered with a bodice and decorated with jewels, and Her rasa-filled eyes are anointed with black collyrium.

Reliquishing everything to become a maidservant at the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā, worship and serve Her with great care.

Beholding the effulgent rays of Her beauty, Rati (the wife of Kāmadeva), Gaurī (the consort of Śiva), and Līlā (the potency of Nārāyaṇa) all abandon their pride.

At Her lotus feet, the good fortune said to belong to Śacī (the wife of Indra), Lakṣmī, and Satyābhāma is completely defeated.

Contending to bring Śrī Kṛṣṇa under their control, Candrāvalī and all the other gopīs accept their defeat before Her.

Bhaktivinoda, a resident of Śrī Godruma, aspires for the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā, the most beloved of Śrī Hari.`
