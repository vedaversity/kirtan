    "en": `O Lord, apart from You, there is nothing else that I can call my own. You alone are my father, friend, and brother.

My friends, wife, sons, and daughters are all Your servants and maid­servants. My endeavors for them are based on that relationship only.

Considering my wealth, family members, home, and possessions to be Yours, I protect them, only as Your servant.

For Your service I shall earn money and bear the expenses of Your household.

I know neither good nor bad—I only serve. I am but a watchman, guarding the interests of Your household.

I engage my senses—hearing, sight, smell, and taste—in accordance with Your desire.

I no longer do anything for the sake of my own pleasure. Bhaktivinoda says, “Your happiness is the essence [of my life].”`
