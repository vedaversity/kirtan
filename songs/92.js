    "en": `To deliver the living beings scorched by the blazing forest fire of material existence, śrī gurudeva manifests like a cloud of compassion and showers his unbounded mercy. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.

His heart intoxicated in the prema-rasa of Śrīman Mahāprabhu’s kīrtana, śrī guru dances, sings, and plays various instruments. Becoming intoxicated by love, his hair stands on end, he shivers, and sheds torrents of tears. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

Śrī gurudeva always worships and serves śrī vigraha, dressing and decorating Them in varieties of raiments and ornaments (that stimulate Their śṛṅgāra-rasa) and performing other services such as cleansing the temple. He also engages the devotees (under his guidance) in these services. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

Śrī guru feels much contentment in satisfying Śrī Hari’s devotees with the four kinds of bhagavat-prasāda—that which is chewed, sucked, licked, and drunk. (By honoring such prasāda, material life is destroyed and true satisfaction, or the bliss of prema, is attained.) I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

At every moment, śrī gurudeva is experiencing intense greed in his heart to relish the unlimited sweetness of the holy names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

In carrying out the sakhīs’ arrangements for the perfection of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s amorous pastimes within the groves of Vṛndāvana, śrī guru is masterfully adept and thus especially dear to Them. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

Scriptures unanimously proclaim śrī guru to be sākṣāt-hari, directlly Śrī Hari. This is a fact jointly corroborated by all saintly persons. Yet at the same time, śrī guru is very dear to Bhagavān. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva (who is inconceivably one with and different from Bhagavān).

Solely by the mercy of śrī guru one can receive the mercy of Bhagavān; without it, one cannot make any advancement. Meditate on and sing śrī guru’s glories at the three sacred junctions of the day. I adore the lotus feet of that śrī gurudeva.

That person who, during brāhma-muhūrta, loudly and attentively recites this Guruvāṣṭakam is sure to achieve direct service to the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the life and soul of Vṛndāvana, at the end of his current life (upon attaining vastu-siddhi, his eternal spiritual form).`
