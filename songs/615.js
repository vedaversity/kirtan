    "en": `O brothers! One day at Śrī Advaita Prabhu’s house in Śāntipura, the two Lords (Śrī Caitanya and Śrī Nityānanda) sat for lunch. Upon tasting the śāk (leafy green vegetable preparation), Lord Caitanya said, “O devotees, this śāk has certainly been enjoyed by Kṛṣṇa!

“Upon one’s tasting this śāk, kṛṣṇa-prema arises in one’s heart. Relish this śāk with love. Forgetting your materialistic conceptions and taking the Lord’s remnants, all of you just chant, ‘Hari! Hari!’ ”`
