    "en": `In the forests of Vraja, along the banks of the Yamunā, there are enchanting platforms beautifully decorated with flowers.

Varieties of fruit trees and creepers give satisfaction to the eyes. On them, many birds sing sweetly.

A cooling breeze from the Malaya Hills blows gently, and a swarm of bumblebees wanders about in search of honey.

The full moon of the spring season continuously distributes its soothing rays out of love.

At such a time, the supreme relisher of nectarean mellows, Mūralīdhara Śrī Kṛṣṇa, begins the rāsa dance.

In the midst of millions of lovely cowherd damsels, Śrī Hari blissfully dances with Rādhā.

Singing beautiful songs, the enchantress of Mādhava captivates the minds of all living beings.

All moving and non-moving beings are enchanted by the chaste Rādhā, who has defeated the pride of Candrāvalī.

After churning Vraja-kiśora’s heart, Rādhārāṇī disappears from the vāsantī-rāsa. 

Bhaktivinoda foresees trouble. In the absence of Rādhā, the rāsa dance has (now) stopped.`
