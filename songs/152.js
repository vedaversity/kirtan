    "en": `Nitāi is a jewel of all virtues—my Nitāi is a jewel of all virtues. He has inundated the entire world with a flood of divine love (prema).

Nitāi has come to the land of Gauḓa (Bengal), bringing that flood of prema. The devotees are submerged in it, but the wretched and lowly remain floating.

He does not discriminate against the wretched, lowly, fallen, and sinful. He freely offers to everyone the prema that is so rare that it is difficult for even Lord Brahmā to attain.

By cutting a channel in the dam holding the unlimited ocean of mercy, Nitāi has caused a flood of nectarean prema to surge in each and every house.

Locana dāsa says, “Whoever has not worshiped my Nitāi knowingly commits suicide.”`
