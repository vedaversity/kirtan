    "en": `The gopīs said: O most beloved, because of Your birth in this land of Vraja, it has become even more glorious [than Vaikuṇṭha and other planets]. It is for this reason that Lakṣmī eternally decorates it with her presence. It is for Your sake alone that we, Your gopīs, maintain our lives. We are searching for You in all directions. Therefore, please show Yourself to us.

O master of amorous pleasure, Śrī Kṛṣṇa! O bestower of benedic­tions, is killing us, your unpaid servants, by the glance of Your eyes, which steal even the proud beauty of the perfectly formed blossomed lotus, not considered murder?

O crest-jewel among men, time and again You have saved us from all kinds of danger: from the poisonous water [of Kāliya-hrada], from Aghāsura, from torrential rains [showered down by Indra], from the whirlwind [created by Tṛṇāvarta], from [Indra’s] fiery thunderbolts, from the bull demon [Ariṣṭāsura], and from the son of Maya Dānava [Vyomāsura].

O friend, You are certainly not only the son of Yaśodā, You are also the Supersoul, who resides in the heart of all living beings. In response to the prayer of Lord Brahmā, You have descended in the Yādava dynasty in order to protect the universe.

O crest-jewel of the Yadu dynasty, O beloved, Your lotus hand grants fearlessness to those souls who, terrified by the cycle of birth and death, surrender to Your lotus feet. O fulfiller of our desires, please place on our heads that very lotus hand that grants fearlessness and that accepted Lakṣmī’s two hands.

O hero, you destroy the sorrows of the residents of Vraja. Your mere smile shatters the pride (arising from the good fortune) of Your near and dear ones (and it also shatters the sulky mood [māna] arising from that pride). O dear friend, we are Your maidservants. (Therefore, for Your own pleasure,) kindly show us Your attractive lotus face.

Your lotus feet destroy the past sins of surrendered souls. Those feet follow behind the cows that graze in the pastures. They are the abode of Lakṣmī-devī, and You placed them upon the hoods of a serpent (Kāliya). Please place those very lotus feet upon our breasts and subdue the lust in our hearts.

O lotus-eyed one, we are bewildered by Your sweet voice and enchanting words, which capture the minds of clever, rasika scholars. O hero, we are Your maidservants. Please restore our lives with the divine ambrosia of Your lips.

Ambrosial narrations about You are the life and soul of those tormented by separation from You. Greatly learned devotees (such as Brahmā, Śiva, and the four Kumāras) sing of them. These narrations vanquish the distress of fructified (prārabda) and unfructified (aprārabda) sins. Simply hearing them bestows auspiciousness, and they bestow the wealth of prema. Persons who glorify Your pastimes expand the nectar of narrations about You. Therefore, that person who performs kīrtana of Your līlā-kathā in this world is the most generous benefactor.

O beloved, meditating on Your smiling face, love-laden glances, amorous play, and heart-touching conversations in secret places bestows the greatest joy. But, O cheater, they also greatly torment our mind.

O master, O beloved, when You leave Vraja to take the cows and other animals out to graze, the soles of Your feet, which are as tender as a lotus, must suffer great pain from sharp pebbles, grass, and the edges of dry grains. When we think about this, our minds become very distressed.

At twilight, when You repeatedly show us Your lotus face, which is framed by bluish-black locks of hair and covered in dust from the hooves of cows, You arouse amorous desire within our heart.

O dearmost beloved, O destroyer of all sorrow, Your lotus feet fulfill all desires of Your surrendered devotees. They are worshiped by Brahmā, and they are the ornament of the Earth. When meditated upon, they remove all calamity; when accepting service, they bestow supreme bliss. Kindly place those lotus feet upon our breasts.

The nectar of Your lips increases the pleasure of amorous union, and it vanquishes sorrow (or separation from You). Your ambrosial lips are passionately kissed by Your singing flute, and they cause every human being to forget all other attachments. O hero, please make us drink the nectar of Your lips.

O beloved, unable to see You as You roam the forest during the day, we experience every moment as a millennium. Then (upon Your return from the forest at dusk,) we eagerly gaze upon Your exquisitely beautiful lotus face adorned with curly locks (and become greatly perturbed by the occasional blinking of our eyes). At that time, the creator of eyelids seems like a fool to us.

O Acyuta, we have come to You, having rejected our husbands, sons, brothers, friends, and our entire family. O cheater, You know very well why we came here. We have come, bewitched by the loud song of Your flute. Who but You would abandon young ladies who have come to You alone in the night?

O beloved master, having seen You as You conversed intimately with us in secret places—Your smiling face, which acts as a stimulus for our amorous desires, Your glancing at us with love, and Your expansive chest, which is the eternal resting place of the goddess of fortune—our hankering to meet with You has increased manifold, and our minds are repeatedly bewildered.

O Kṛṣṇa, Your appearance [on this earth] completely destroys the sorrows of Vraja’s residents, and in every way it brings auspiciousness to the world. Our hearts long for You alone. Therefore, kindly give in charity a little bit of that medicine, which can cure the heart-disease of Your dear ones.

O beloved, fearing that Your tender lotus feet will be hurt, we carefully place them on our hard breasts. With those very same feet, You wander in the forest. Are Your feet not in pain, injured by needle-sharp stones and other sharp objects? You are our very life; thinking of all this fills our hearts with great distress.

Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: O King [Parīkṣit], having thus sung and lamented in various ways, the gopīs began to weep bitterly in sweet voices, greatly eager  to see their beloved Kṛṣṇa.

Just then, Madana-mohana Śrī Kṛṣṇa directly appeared before the weeping vraja-devīs, gently smiling and wearing a forest garland and a yellow garment.`
