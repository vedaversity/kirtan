    "en": `Accompanied by His aṅgas (associates Nityānanda and Advaita), upāṅgas (servitors such as Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and other pure devotees) and pārṣadas (confidential companions such as Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, Śrī Rāya Rāmānanda, Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita, and the six Gosvāmīs), and equipped with His weapon [the names of Hari], Śrī Gaurāṅga, the embodiment of bhāva, dances in great delight.
