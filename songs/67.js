    "en": `His round face is so lovely, His beautiful ears are adorned with hanging jewelled earrings, and His body is nicely anointed with fragrant sandalwood paste. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

His eyes are elongated like lotuses; peacock feathers adorn His head; and He enchants millions of Cupids. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

From the tip of His beautiful nose hangs an elephant pearl, His rows of teeth shine naturally [like pearls], and His bodily complexion shines like a fresh raincloud. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

His hands are adorned with a flute, His majestic gait excels that of the king of elephants, and He is beautified by fine yellow garments. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

His threefold bending form is most beautiful, His nails glow like the moon, and He is adorned by priceless gems. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

His body exudes an extraordinarily enchanting fragrance, and upon His broad chest the kaustubha gem shines, along with the mark of Śrīvatsa. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

He is Vṛndāvana’s expert paramour, who dresses in a manner to enhance His charming, playful pastimes and who liberates Indra from his pride. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

The exquisite lover of the damsels of Vraja always bestows happiness upon all living entities and enchants their mind. I offer praṇāma to that Śrī Nanda-nandana.

Whoever with faith recites these eight verses glorifying the son of Nanda will easily conquer the insurmountable ocean of material existence and attain shelter at His two lotus feet.`
