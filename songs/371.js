    "en": `O my dear sakhī, who has made me hear the name 'Śyāma'? Entering my heart through my ears, this name agitates my soul.

I do not know how much sweetness fills this name of Śyāma, for my tongue cannot leave it. As I go on repeating this name, I lose control of myself. O sakhī! How shall I ever be able to meet Him?

If His name has the power to put me in such a condition, what will happen at the touch of His body? Wherever He is, how can the young women of that place maintain their religious principles?

In my heart I want to forget Him, but my memories do not leave me. What shall I do? What will be the remedy? Caṇḍīdāsa says, “Śyāma has destroyed the chastity of all virtuous ladies by flaunting His youthfulness.”`
