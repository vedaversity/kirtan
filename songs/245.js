    "en": `Oh, when, giving up all bodily pleasures, will I wander under various trees and vines on the banks of the Suradhunī [Gaṅgā] in Gaura-vana [Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma], weeping and calling out, “Hā Rādhe! Hā Kṛṣṇa!”?

I shall eat by begging from the homes of the untouchables and drink water from the Sarasvatī River. I shall roll on the ground on the river’s bank, loudly calling out Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s names.

Offering my obeisances to all the dhāma-vāsīs, I shall beg a drop of mercy from them. Smearing the dust of the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas upon my body, I shall don the cloth of an avadhūta.

I shall see no distinction between the residents of Gauḓa and those of Vraja, and will thus become a true vrajavāsī myself. The transcendental form of the dhāma will appear to my vision, and I shall become a maidservant of Śrī Rādhā.`
