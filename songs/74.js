    "en": `By the mercy of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Govardhana became the emperor of all mountains and received the offerings [meant for Indra], despite Indra’s enmity. May that Govardhana fulfill my desire.

Feeling the softness of his dearmost Kṛṣṇa’s lotus hand, when he was being held aloft by Him, filled Govardhana with so much bliss that he did not even notice Indra’s thunderbolts striking his body. May that Govardhana fulfill my desire.

[At Dana-ghāṭī] Kṛṣṇa instigated a quarrel with the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu in order to extract tax. My great longing is to hear that sweet quarrel. May that Śrī Govardhana fulfill my desire.

Like an elephant, the pleasant breeze, having just bathed in the lakes [such as Mānasī-gaṅgā], beautifully frolics, rolling about in the pollen ‘dust’ of the kadamba and various other flowers. May that Śrī Govardhana fulfill my desire.

“Did Śrī Kṛṣṇa sleep on a bed of musk here?” The natural, sweet fragrance of Govardhana’s śilās causes devotees to continuously contemplate in this way. May that Govardhana fulfill my desire.

The deer on Govardhana start running upon hearing the sound of the wind blowing through the holes of all the bamboo trees, thinking that Kṛṣṇa is there playing His flute. Not finding Him, they are astonished and wander here and there, searching for Him. May that Govardhana fulfill my desire.

At Mānasī-gaṅgā, Śrī Rādhā boarded the boat [manned by Kṛṣṇa, disguised as a boatman]. When the boat reached the middle [of the lake], it began to sink. As She tightly clung to Kṛṣṇa’s neck, They looked very beautiful. May that Govardhana fulfill my desire.

Without taking shelter of the feet of Govardhana, who is the best of Śrī Hari’s servants, how can one ever attain bhakti? For this reason, with the desire of attaining prema-bhakti for my Lord and Lady, I take shelter of him. May that Śrī Govardhana fulfill my desire.

One who, with a melting heart, recites these eight verses about the best of the servants of Śrī Hari, which award splendid realizations, will without delay attain the direct service of the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhikā-Mādhava.`
