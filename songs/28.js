    "en": `Rādhā’s eyes glance in every direction, appearing like a lotus moving in a gentle breeze.

As Rādhā enters the pastime forest, Kāmadeva arises and obstructs Her at every step.

Her steps are slow and gentle, like the graceful gait of an elephant.

May these words spoken by the poet Rāmānanda Rāya bring happiness to Gajapati Mahārāja Pratāparudra.`
