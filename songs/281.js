    "en": `O mind, how will you ultimately take shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa?

Having had the desire to take shelter of those lotus feet since time immemorial, this wretched servant simply is waiting.

O Rādhe, O Kṛṣṇa-candra, life and soul of the devotees! Please bestow upon this most sinful person bhakti to both of You.

Please do not neglect me, saying that I am devoid of bhakti. Instead, give this ignorant person your auspicious instructions on spiritual knowledge.

Please give this servant, who is afflicted by the thirst for material enjoyment, the qualification to serve in Your amorous pastimes.

This restless current of life flows, running into the ocean of time [death]. The days that have gone will not come again. Alas, Kṛṣṇa, what am I to do now?

You are the friends of the fallen. I know who You are, my Masters! You are indeed the very ocean of kindness.

I am unfortunate and exceedingly foolish. I do not understand even an iota of bhakti. O my Masters, by virtue of Your greatness, take my soul and make me Your own, thereby vanquishing my material sufferings.

Give me a perfected spiritual body within the transcendental abode of Vṛndāvana and bestow upon me in charity the nectar of service to You. After making me drink prema and thus become spiritually intoxicated, hear me sing Your glories.

Please engage me in service to You in the arena of the rāsa dance. This unworthy maidservant of Śrī Lalitā Sakhī, Bhaktivinoda, beseeches You by clasping Your lotus feet.`
