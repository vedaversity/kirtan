    "en": `If Śrī Rādhā is merciful to me, then unlimited obstacles [to my devotion] will be removed. There will be nothing superior for me to attain because I will have received the excellence offered by the paths of both vaidhī and rāga. And if She speaks something while smiling gently, thereby revealing the brilliance of the rows of Her beautiful pearl-like teeth, what significance will the oyster of liberation have?

O Śyāmasundara! O You whose head is adorned with peacock feathers, whose face is graced with a laughing smile, whose muralī flute enchants the mind, and who are most expert in relishing rasa with Śrīmatī Rādhikā. O ocean of mercy, please make me a kiṅkarī (maidservant) at the feet at Your beloved.

You are the Lord of the life of the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, and You are like a bee, always eager to taste the nectar of Her lotus-like face. O Rasikendra-śekhara (foremost of those who are rasika), who are situated at the feet of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, I worship You.

O son of the king of Vraja, O all-pervading one, O Mohana (who enchants the minds of all), taking a piece of straw in my teeth, I pray that Your supremely beloved [Śrī Rādhā] be my dear, worshipful goddess, birth after birth.`
