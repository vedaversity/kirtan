    "en": `The Lord of lords, Śrī Gaura-candra, along with Nityānanda Prabhu, revels in the house of Gaurīdāsa Paṇḍita in Ambikā-kālnā.

He wears a beautiful red guñjā-mālā that extends to His lotus heart. Brahmā and Lakṣmī worship His lotus feet with great respect.

The radiance of His body shines like molten gold, and His cloth is saffron like the rising sun. He desires the prema-bhakti of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, which is full of anurāga.

The son of Śacī, Śrī Gaura-candra, is internally blissful. He playfully roams about with Nityānanda Prabhu, the vanquisher of atheists.

Both Nityānanda and Gaura-candra are in the house of Gaurīdāsa, who hopes that They will deliver all jīvas.`
