    "en": `O Hari! When will such a day be mine? I shall develop attachment to pure-hearted Vaiṣṇavas, by which my material desires will be subdued.

No disparity shall remain between my internal and external behavior. I shall not desire honor for myself and shall instead offer respect to others. I shall remain constantly absorbed in chanting Kṛṣṇa's names and remembering Him.

I shall perform my bodily activities out of habit, just to maintain my life. I shall become attached only to that which is favorable to bhajana of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

I shall firmly reject whatever is unfavorable for bhajana. Absorbed in bhajana, when the time comes, I shall readily give up this body.

With these aspirations, Bhaktivinoda resides in the forest of Godruma. He always weeps in a solitary place, anxious at heart to receive the mercy of the Lord.`
