    "en": `His complexion rebukes the hue of a fresh thundercloud. He is an ocean of rasa and the king of paramours. His head is adorned with the crest of a lovely peacock feather, auspiciously tilted [to the left in obeisance to the feet of Śrī Rādhā]. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

His arching eyebrows resemble the bow of Indra (the rainbow). His moonlike face belittles millions of moons. He has a mild, gentle, sweet smile and fine speech. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

Kṛsna’s trembling form (aṅga) is the true body of Anaṅga . His way of dressing fascinates the residents of Vraja. He is adorned with extraordinary eyes that resemble blue lotuses. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

His brow is surrounded by rows of curly locks, on His ears swing mākara-shaped earrings, and His waist is nicely attired in yellow silken cloth. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja!

Ankle bells tinkle and illuminate His beautiful feet, which are adorned by charming jewelled ornaments. The fragrance of those feet intoxicates enraptured honey bees. Those two feet are marked with the flag, thunderbolt, fish [and other charming symbols]. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

His beautiful body is smeared generously with sandalwood paste. The light from His Kaustubha gem eclipses the sun. He has appeared as the crest-jewel of young boys in Vraja. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

He is nicely worshiped by the hosts of gods as Mukunda (He who bestows liberation) and Hari (He who dispels inauspiciousness). He is the crown-jewel of lords of all gods and is the guru of all. He is the lifter of Giri-Govardhana, the killer of the Mura demon, and He is the master of Lord Śiva. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.

He is immersed in sweet, amorous play with the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja. His attire is that of rasa-rāja-śiromaṇi, the crest-jewel of emperors who relish transcendental mellows. He is the master of the cosmic manifestation, the Supreme Controller, and the best amongst all those worthy of worship. Just worship the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of the king of Vraja.`
