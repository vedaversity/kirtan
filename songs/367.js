    "en": `O mind, realize, just realize that you are very wicked! (You are in the poison of sense enjoyment.) You are absorbed in lust, anger, greed, illusion, intoxication, and so on.

(You are under the control of these enemies.) You are drawn by your thirst for mundane talk, sense enjoyment, and liberation. (Mundane talk is very palatable to you.) You are oppressed by the desire for fame, duplicity, cheating, and so on.

(You have not become honest.) O my brother, all these calamities have surrounded you. (They are all enemies.) Without giving them up, how will you attain Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa?

(Try to give them up. Just leave them!) By not associating with sādhus, what do you expect to achieve? (Associate with the sādhus!) Absorb yourself in the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas, for by doing so, your evils will be removed.

(Think about this, just once.)`
