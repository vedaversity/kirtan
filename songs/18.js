    "en": `O my dear friend, just think about the magnanimous Śrī Gaurāṅga, whose bodily luster rebukes the splendor of gold and who smashes the pride of Cupid.

His curly locks, which defeat the splendor of dark rain clouds, are adorned with mālati flowers surrounded by delighted honeybees. His tilaka insults the beauty of the moon, and His attire enchants the whole world.

His smile, sweet like honey, allures all embodied beings. His pastimes are filled with unparalleled sentiments of pure love (bhāvas). His mind is captivated by the heroine of Nidhuvana, as He utters indecipherable words in a choked voice.

It is His nature to distribute mercy to those souls who are utterly destitute [having no wealth other than Kṛṣṇa and service to Him], as well as to those who hanker for material possessions. His incomparable pastimes have thrown this foolish person named Rādhā-mohana into confusion.`
