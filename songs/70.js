    "en": `In the beautiful land of Gauḍa, on the extremely charming bank of the sacred Gaṅgā, Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma is splendidly situated, eternally filled with bliss—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Some claim it to be Vaikuṇṭha; others say it is Goloka. However, those who have realized the truth say it is none other than Śrī Vṛndāvana—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Cooled by gentle breezes from all directions and surrounded by sublime groves of many kinds of trees, Śrī Navadvīpa provides the setting for Śrī Gaurasundara’s midday pastimes—I am remem­bering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Where the celestial Gaṅgā flows with great pleasure, her charming banks adorned with golden stairs, and her waters filled with waves that gracefully bathe Śrī Gaurasundara—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Where there are countless stunning, vast, and mind-enchanting golden houses in which Lakṣmī-devī eternally resides—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Where surrendered people are ornamented with all saintly virtues, such as wisdom, compassion, forgiveness and sacrifice, and are glorified by sages, demigods, and siddhas—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Within its heart lies the home of Purandara Miśra [Jagannātha Miśra], which is the only abode of transcendental happiness, because it is enriched by Śrī Gaurāṅga’s birth and other sweet pastimes—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Where Śrī Gaurahari roamed with His devotees as they performed saṅkīrtana filled with prema, thus submerging everyone in an ocean of blissful transcendental madness—I am remembering that Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

One who recites with a loving heart these eight verses, which are enriched with contemplations on Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma, can achieve that most rare prema for the lotus feet of the beautiful son of Śacī-devī.`
