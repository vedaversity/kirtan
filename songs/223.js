    "en": `The river of gaura-rasa came as a bank of rain clouds, flooding the land of Gauḓa with a shower of prema.

Nityānanda Rāya assisted as the wind, blowing that shower of prema where it did not fall.

Śrī Advaita-candra came as thunderclaps and Rāmānanda Rāya came as rain, letting loose a stream of rasa.

The sixty-four great saints came, beautifying that cloud bank, and Śrī Rūpa-Sanātana flashed as its lightning.

Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja became the storekeeper of that rasa. He collected that prema and kept it carefully in a golden pot.

They distributed this prema to the people of the world, but due to his misfortune, this Locana dāsa did not receive a single drop.`
