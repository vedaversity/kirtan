    "en": `The youthful Divine Couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, are my life and soul. In life and in death, I have no shelter other than Them.

On the banks of the Kālindi (Yamunā River), in a kadamba grove meant for amorous sporting, I will seat Them both upon a jeweled throne.

I will anoint Their dark and golden limbs with sandal paste scented with cuyā and then fan Them with a cāmara. Oh, when will I behold Their moon-like faces?

After stringing together garlands of mālati flowers, I will place them around both Their necks. I will then place tāmbūla (betel) flavored with camphor in Their lotus mouths.

On the order of Lalitā, Viśākhā, and the other sakhīs, I will serve Their lotus feet.

Narottama dāsa, servant of the servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, yearns for service to the Divine Couple.`
