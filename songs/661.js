duniẏādārī svapnakā khelā
jānā tujhako paḍ̌egā akelā,
bhaja le harikā nāma re

govindakī mahimā gāke,
premake usa para phāga lagāke
jīvana apanā saphala vanā le,
cala īśvarake dhāma re`,

    "en": `Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, and worship Govinda’s name. But for Govinda’s name, nothing will be of use.

Life is a circus of joy and sorrow, and this world is but a play of dreams. All alone, you will have to leave it, so worship Hari’s name.

Sing the glories of Govinda, combined with the melodies of prema. Make your life worthwhile, and hurry to the abode of the Lord.`
