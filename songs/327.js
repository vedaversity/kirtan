    "en": `Listen, O those who relish nectarean mellows, the transcendental qualities of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are innumerable. Even Lord Ananta [who has millions of hoods and mouths] cannot describe them all. Kṛṣṇa is the spiritual master of the entire universe, He is a wish-fulfilling desire-tree, and He is the navigator, guiding us across the ocean of material existence.

For those whose hearts are ill, Kṛṣṇa is the doctor; He is expert at destroying the disease of material existence. By distributing the nectar of prema to all those who are averse to Him, He gradually takes them to His own confidential realm.

Human beings are blinded by their absorption in the bindings of karma and jñāna, but Kṛṣṇa, who is an ocean of mercy, removes their blindness by granting them the honey of His lotus feet. In this way, He makes them servants of those lotus feet.

By granting the jewel of independence to those following vidhi-mārga, the path of regulative principles, He allows them to enter rāga-mārga, the path of spontaneous loving attachment. Being controlled by such attachment and taking shelter of parakīya-bhāva (paramour love), the jīva attains ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa.

Such devotees are always engaged in drinking from the stream of the nectar of prema, for Kṛṣṇa is their friend and master. These residents of Vraja, who are abodes of auspiciousness, are the refuge of the poor and fallen Bhaktivinoda.`
