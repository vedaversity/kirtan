    "en": `O Rādhā, who are full of prema, where are You? Rādhe! All glories to you!

Rādhe! Give me Your darśana and save my life. Your wretched beggar calls out to You, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

Rādhe! You engage in amorous pastimes in Vṛndāvana. Rādhe! You are the enchantress of the mind of Kānu.

Rādhe! You are the crest-jewel among Your eight principal sakhīs.  Rādhe! You are the charming daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja.

As a practice, Śrīla Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī is continually calling out, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

One time he calls out at Keśī-ghāṭa; another time he calls out at Vaṁśī-vaṭa, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

One time he calls out at Nidhuvana; another time he calls out at Sevā-kuñja, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

One time he calls out at Rādhā-kuṇḍa; another time he calls out at Śyāma-kuṇḍa, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

One time he calls out at Kusuma-sarovara; another time he calls out at Govardhana, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

One time he calls out at Tālavana; another time he calls out at Tamālavana, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

Wearing faded and worn cloth, he rolls in the dust of Vraja, singing, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

Calling out, “Rādhe! Rādhe!” he becomes submerged in the tears flowing from his eyes. “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

He wanders throughout the lanes of Vṛndāvana, weeping and exclaiming, “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

Throughout fifty-six daṇḍas of the day and night, he knows nothing but Rādhā-Govinda. “Rādhe! Rādhe!”

Then he takes rest for only four daṇḍas [one hour thirty-six minutes] and sees Rādhā-Govinda in his dreams. “Rādhe! Rādhe!”`
