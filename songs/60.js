    "en": `I adore the radiant lotus feet of the lifter of Govardhana Hill, which are worshiped by Śrī Rādhā, who was born from a lotus.

I adore His lotus feet, which bear the marks of a flag, a lightening-bolt, an elephant goad, and a lotus, and which are embellished with saffron powder from the breasts of the young girls of Vraja.

I adore His lotus feet, which awaken delight, being bedecked with beautiful bejeweled anklets, and which also stimulate amorous desire in the stunned damsels [of Vraja].

I adore His lotus feet, the brilliant crimson hue of which [is so amazing that it] makes one dumb. Those feet have made Govinda dāsa into a bee, eager to drink their honey.`
