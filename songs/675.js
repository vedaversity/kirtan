ghara ghara tulasī, ṭhākura pūjā, 
darśana govindajī ko

nirmala nīra vahata ẏamunā ko, 
bhojana dūdha dahī ko

ratna siṁhāsana āpa virāje, 
mukuṭa dharyo tulasī ko

kuñjana kuñjana rahata rādhikā, 
śabda sunata muralī ko

mīrā ke prabhu giridharanāgara, 
bhajana vinā nara phīko`,

    "en": `O Friend!  I like Vṛndāvana so much. There, tulasī and Ṭhākurajī are worshiped in every home, and one can obtain darśana of Govindajī.

The pure waters of the Yamunā flow there, and the meals consist of milk and yogurt.

On a jeweled throne, You [the deity] sit, with tulāsi for a crown.

Rādhikā roams from grove to grove, hearing the sound of the flute.

Mīrā’s master is the heroic Giridhārī. Without doing bhajana, a person is dull.`
