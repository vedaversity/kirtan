    "en": `Within the pleasure-groves of Śrī Vṛndāvana, You and Śrī Kṛṣṇa constantly delight in amorous pastimes, enthralled like two intoxicated elephants. O Devī! Be pleased with me and mercifully grant me darśana of Your two lotus-like faces.

O Devī Gāndharvikā! In utter distress, falling to the ground like a rod, I implore you in a choked voice full of despair and pray at Your lotus feet: please be merciful to this fool and count me as one of Your own.

O Śyāmā! The entire world is enchanted by the beauty of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, but the beauty of You and Śyāma, who embraces You with His left arm, is super-excellent. When will I worship You, whose unique beauty is rare even for Lakṣmī-devī?

O Devī! When (as Your sakhī ) will I cover You in a rain-cloud-colored garment, remove the ankle bells from Your feet, and lead You, who are so full of delight, to a kuñja for a nocturnal rendezvous with Śrī Nanda-nandana?

Within a kuñja, on a pleasure-bed made of many types of flowers, You are both thoroughly absorbed in sweet, joking pastimes. Oh, when (at such a time) will this person massage Your lotus feet, which are the ornaments of the three worlds?

O Vṛndāvaneśvarī! Due to the exertion of love-sports on the bank of Your pond, drops of perspiration caress the lotus faces of You and Your beloved. As You both relax (upon a jeweled siṁhāsana) in the shade of a tree, when will I fan Your bodies with a cāmara?

(When You playfully hide in a secret place within a kuñja and Śrī Kṛṣṇa comes to know where You are hiding and approaches You, You will ask me, “O Rūpa-mañjarī, why did you reveal My hiding- place to Kṛṣṇa?” I will then reply,) “O beautiful-eyed Rādhikā! It was Citra Sakhī, not I, who informed Mukunda of Your hiding place in the kuñja. Therefore, please do not frown and become unfairly angry with me.” When will I thus beseech You in the presence of Vrajendra-nandana?

When, in a prankish mood, You defeat Vrajendra-nandana in a battle of words, You become exceedingly jubilant. You exult in the pride of Your oratory prowess as You are extolled by Your overjoyed sakhīs. When will I behold You in such a state?

Anyone who takes shelter of Śrī Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī (Śrī Rādhikā) by regularly reciting this entreaty with great faith will surely please Her, along with Her beloved Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and thus become the recipient of the waves of Their profuse mercy.`
