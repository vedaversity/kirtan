    "en": `Forgetting You and falling into worldliness, I have suffered many pains. Now, falling at Your feet, I shall tell You my woeful tale.

When I was still in my mother’s womb, I was tightly confined. Once, O Lord, You appeared to me. However, this lowly servitor was simply cheated...

...for I thought that I would take birth and serve You. Instead, I was born and fell into the net of māyā, without a trace of wisdom.

Smothered with affection by my family members, sitting in their laps laughing, I wasted time. I forgot everything for the fondness of my parents; worldly life struck me as quite appealing.

I gradually became a small child, playing with other small children. As my awareness of the world grew, I began my daily schooling.

Proud of my learning, I travelled abroad in search of wealth. Fixated on the maintenance of my family, I forgot You, O Hari!

Now aged, Bhaktivinoda weeps, greatly distressed. In not serving You, all my days were wasted. Now what will become of me?`
