    "en": `Glory to Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda! Glory to Advaitacandra! And glory to all the devotees of Śrī Gaura

I beg all of you to please be merciful to me. Please do not despise or reject this most fallen person who is approaching You all.

Your lotus feet are the most valuable thing in this material world. I always see Your lotus feet within my mind. I have no other goal.

I hope to one day attain Your lotus feet, and this causes great pain to arises within my mind. I constantly cry, my heart full of suffering.

I do not see how I will ever be able to attain Your lotus feet. I do not see how I can always remember the lotus feet of Lokanatha Gosvami, my spiritual master.

O master, if you are at all merciful to me, then please glance upon me one time. Please dispel the darkness in Narottama dasa's heart.`
