    "en": `O You who are the delight of the people of Vraja—Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!

His crown is of peacock feathers, His earrings are shark-shaped, around His neck is a forest flower garland, and the bells on His feet resonate rasa—Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!

With His beautiful face, eyes like lotus petals, and His crooked and enticing posture, He frolics in forests and hearts, captivating all with His artistry in flute-playing—Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!

In Vṛndāvana, He tends the cows, absconds with the minds of the cowherd girls, and holds up Śrī Govardhana—Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!

Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa now unite in one golden incarnation, preaching the religion of devotional singing (kīrtana-dharma)—Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!

Without You, I have no other. You incarnate in the divine name and in divine form. At Your feet rapture is found. This Nārāyaṇa delights there. Rādhe! Śyāma! Śyāmā! Śyāma!`
