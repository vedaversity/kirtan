    "en": `If your heart is eager to be perpetually absorbed in drinking the ambrosial rasa of Śrī Hari’s lotus feet, then abandon that home which is filled with the nature of Kali [worldly attachments], and perform bhajana of [Śrī Gauracandra] the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Wealth, youth, duration of life, royal happiness – none are permanent, as they are prone to destruction at every moment. Give up all chit-chat, which bears no fruit, and perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

O friend, the pleasure to be had in the company of women ultimately leads to dread [in the form of continuous bondage in the cycle of birth and death], and it robs one of human life’s true goal [prema]. With the ambrosial rasa of śrī harināma intoxicating your mind, perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

The rasa of worldly poetry is certainly devoid of actual poetic mellow. True rasa is indeed gaura-rasa [that is, vipralambha-rasa] the purifier of the age of Kali, and is found in the pastimes and narrations of Śrī Gaurahari. There is no purpose in cultivating an understanding of any other subject. Just perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

The gallant son of Nanda, with the daughter of Śrī Vṛṣabhānu to His left, is lost in the delight of playing sweet melodies on His muralī flute on the banks of the Yamunā River. Just perform bhajana of [He who is non-different from that son of Nanda Mahāräja], the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

In the midst of śrī hari-kīrtana and surrounded by His loving companions is that Śrī Hari who is resplendent with a golden hue. He is an ocean of exclusive mercy for His Gauḍīya bhaktas. Just perform bhajana of that moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

The daughter of the Himalayas (the Ganges River) encircles His home. He is the Lord of the nine islands of Navadvīpa. He steals the heart of the renunciants, and the host of demigods worship Him and His beloved wife, Viṣṇupriyā-devī. Just perform bhajana of that moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

To chastise the dog-like age of Kali, He has adopted the nature of a club. He is engaged in distributing the great medicine of śrī harināma. He has assumed a form that becomes exceedingly beautiful as it melts with compassion for the fallen and suffering souls. Just perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

His words of compassion for all constantly issue forth from [what seems to be] hundreds of lotus mouths, since He distinguishes not between friend or foe. He is the son of the king of Vraja who, in this age of Kali, has appeared in a golden form. Just perform bhajana of that moon of the forest of Godruma.

The Upaniṣads extol the glories of that almighty Lord, who is the son of Jagannātha Miśra, best of the brahmaṇas. That Śrī Hari of golden hue perpetually sports with His dear companions within His own abode – Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma. Just perform bhajana of that moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

He is the source of all avatāras, and the complete resting place of all other expansions [replete with all of His sixteen kalās, or portions]. He is the Supreme Absolute Truth, who is fully absorbed in His delightful pastimes in Navadvīpa. He embodies the hidden rasa of the nectarean ocean of Vraja-dhāma. Just perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Without performing bhajana, Vedic knowledge, an elevated birth, wealth and so forth, are unable to invoke His mercy. O friend, with selflessness on the path of transcendental emotion, perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

He had effortlessly delivered an agonized person who had taken birth as a crocodile in the lake known as Gaura-hrada. He is unborn, inconceivably powerful and a desire tree of auspiciousness [prema]. Perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Satisfied by the austerities of Surabhi and Indra, Śrī Hari advented with a most beautiful golden lustre. He embodies incessant joy and He steals the composure of the sages. Perform bhajana of that moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

The multitude of separate desires [anyabhilāṣa], the conception of non-differentiated oneness [the feeling, “I am brahma (supreme spirit)”] and worldly activities, both auspicious and inauspicious give them all up. With an attitude that is favourable for loving service to Him, perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Being devoted to the service of Śrī Hari’s servants, addicted to drinking the ambrosial nectar of śrī harināma, and endowed with the moods of submission, humility, compassion and respect for others, perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Always call out, “O Yādava, O Mādhava, O Kṛṣṇa, O Hari! O Rāma, O Janārdana, O Keśava, O beloved Lord of Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī, Śrīmatī Rādhikā!” In this way perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Call out, “O Lord of the banks of Yamunā, the forests of Vraja and Govardhana Hill!” Call out, “O You who are the sun of the forest groves of Gokula!” Call out, “O Gaurahari, the elixir of life in the rāsa-pastimes [saṅkīrtana-rasa]! Call out these names and thus perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Go to the nine islands of Gaurahari’s forest [Navadvīpa-dhāma]. With delight, read about and recite the wonderful activities of Gaurahari. Roll on the banks of the River Ganges, which is marked with Gaurahari’s footprints, and in this way perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.

Remember Gaura-Gadādhara’s charming, playful pastimes, remain ever partial to Gaura-Gadādhara, listen to the fascinating narrations of Gaura-Gadādhara, and in this way perform bhajana of the moon of Godruma’s forest bowers.`
