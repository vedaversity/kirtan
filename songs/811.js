    "en": `Perpetually residing within my wicked heart are the six enemies, headed by lust, as well as duplicity, the desire for recognition, and deceit. 

My prayer at the lotus feet of Śrī Nṛsiṁhadeva is that He will purify my heart and awaken longing within me for [serving] Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

When will I, crying at the feet of Śrī Nṛsimhadeva, beg him that I may engage in the bhajana of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Yugala in Śrī Navadvipa-dhāma, safe from all danger?

When will that Śrī Hari, the sight of whom strikes fear into fear itself, become pleased with me and show me His mercy?

Although He appears as the embodiment of terror to the wicked, to Prahlāda and other devotees of Śrī Kṛṣṇa He is exceedingly kind and gentle.

When oh when will He be pleased with me and, speaking words brimming with compassion, make this insignificant fool fearless?

[He will say,] “O dear child, reside here freely in Śrī Gaurāṅga’s abode. May you remain engaged in the loving service of the Divine Couple, and may you develop deep attraction for śrī nāma. 

“On the strength of My devotees’ mercy, all obstacles are cast far away. With a pure heart, engage in bhajana of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, which is saturated with rasa.”

After having said such, when will that Lord happily place His lotus feet upon my head? 

At once, in the divine prema of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Yugala, I shall undergo ecstatic transformations (sattvika-vikāra) and roll about on the ground at the door of Śrī Nṛsiṁhadeva’s temple.`
