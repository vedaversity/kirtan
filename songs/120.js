    "en": `O Vaiṣṇava Gosāi, be merciful to me now. You are the savior of the fallen souls. Except for you, there is no one [who can deliver me].

Where can one find such a merciful personality by whose mere proximity one’s sins go far away?

Only after touching the Gaṅgā does one become purified, but simply by seeing you, one is purified. This is your great quality.

Offenses committed at the lotus feet of Śrī Hari are absolved by harināma, but for offenses against you there is absolutely no means of deliverance.

Śrī Govinda is always resting in your heart. Govinda thus says, “The Vaiṣṇavas are My life and soul!”

In every birth, I aspire for the dust of your lotus feet. Be compassionate to this Narottama dāsa and consider me your own.`
