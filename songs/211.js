    "en": `The two Lords, Nitāi and Gaura-candra, are supremely merciful. They are the essence and the crown-jewels of all avatāras, and They are the source of absolute bliss.

O brother, worship Caitanya-Nitāi with unwavering faith. Renouncing material enjoyment and drowning yourself in that rasa [of worshiping Them], let your lips chant, “Hari, Hari!”

Just see, dear brother! In all the three worlds, no one bestows mercy like They do. Animals and birds shed tears and stones melt upon hearing narrations of Their glories.

Locana dāsa says, “Since you remain submerged in material enjoyment, the aspiration to take shelter of Their lotus feet has not arisen. Thus you suffer the consequences of your own misdeeds, as meted out by Lord Yama.”`
