    "en": `All glories, all glories to harināma, the abode of the nectar of divine knowledge and bliss and the Supreme Truth in the form of syllables. Out of mercy for His devotees, He descended in the form of His names and thus showed vast compassion to all the living beings.

All glories to the holy names of Hari and Kṛṣṇa, which are the sublime shelter for the living entities of the world and which delight the minds of all. Hosts of great sages, who have true honor for these names, eternally sing them, filling their mouths [with nāma].

O syllables of Kṛṣṇa’s name, You possess all powers to bestow auspiciousness upon the living beings. Without You, there is no other friend to deliver us from the ocean of material existence. Indeed, You have come to deliver all jīvas.

You dispel whatever misery afflicts the jīva, if he, feeling himself poor and insignificant and seeing no other remedy, calls Your name one time, even out of impulse.

If one obtains even a momentary vision of You, then all sorts of terrible miseries disappear, and one’s gross and subtle bodies are easily destroyed. Bhaktivinoda says, “All glories, all glories to the holy names of Śrī Hari! I prostrate myself in hopes of attaining Your lotus feet.”`
