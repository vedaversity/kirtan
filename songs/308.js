jara jara tanu mana,    acetana anukṣaṇa,

    "en": `O master of my life, this person places an appeal before You.  O Govinda, O moon of Gokula, O source of all transcendental bliss, O beloved of the gopis, please cast Your glance upon me.

O my Lord, You are an ocean of mercy.  Please give me the treasure of service to Your lotus feet.  Hearing Your supremely auspicious glories is the greatest nectar for the ears.  If You bestow Your mercy, then what difficult task cannot be accomplished?

I wander through this world of suffering, my mind fixed on the objects of the senses, which bring only pain, and my chest pierced by the javelin of forgetfulness of You.  My body and mind are withered and shattered, and from moment to moment I become unconscious.  Immersed in pain, I am like a living corpse.

Please give me Your merciful glance.  Make me Your servant and allow me to stay in Vrndavana.  The golden-complexioned person who bears the name Sri Krsna Caitanya is my master.  Narottama dasa takes shelter of Him.`
