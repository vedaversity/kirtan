    "en": `In consequence to my actions since time immemorial, I have plunged into the ocean of material existence and see no means of deliverance. Due to the poison of worldly pleasures, my heart blazes day and night and my mind never receives any comfort.

The bonds of hundreds upon hundreds of desires constantly give me pain—such is the play of the waves of the ocean of worldly life. The six rogues, headed by lust and anger, dispense fear as the end draws near.

Having cheated me, the two thugs of jñāna and karma finally throw me into that ocean’s waters. This is a critical time, O Kṛṣṇa, my dear friend. Kindly lift me from those waters with Your strength, for You are an ocean of compassion.

Taking this fallen servant and making him a particle of dust at Your lotus feet, give this Bhaktivinoda sanctuary. O merciful Lord, I am actually Your eternal servant, but having forgotten this, I remain bound by the trap of māyā.`
