    "en": `If you wish to engage your mind in the performance of śrī kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, then you must very carefully earn [the required] spiritual qualification.

Relinquishing your false pride, always consider yourself more lowly and insignificant than a blade of grass, destitute, and worthless.

Cultivate forbearance like that of a tree. Forsaking retaliation, nurture and support others.

In the course of leading your life, do not give anxiety to anyone else. For the benefit of others, forget your own comforts.

Even if you are a great soul endowed with all good qualities, relinquish the desire for honor and make your heart humble.

Knowing Śrī Kṛṣṇa to be situated within all living beings, always respect and show affection to all.

Endowed with the four qualities of humility, compassion, respect, and modesty, perform kīrtana of the Lord.

Bhaktivinoda, weeping at the feet of the Lord, asks, “Oh, when will You give me such qualification?”`
