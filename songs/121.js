    "en": `How can a wicked person like me ever attain devotional service? I have not developed any attachment to śrī guru and the Vaiṣṇavas.

My mind is ceaselessly absorbed in material pursuit. Not even the slightest bit of attachment to the Vaiṣṇavas has developed within me.

Having grown delirious as a result of continuous sense gratification, I have become blind and the witch of māyā has tied a noose [of material desires] around my neck.

There is no way to defeat Māyā and obtain release from her, without the mercy of saintly persons.

O Master! You never see the faults of others, and you are the savior of the fallen. Now, please deliver this Narottama dāsa.`
