kṛṣṇera prasāda anna,    trijagat kare dhanya,
tripurāri nāce ʝāhā pāi”`,

    "en": `O brothers! Once, Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī was taking prasādam at Mother Śacī’s house. As he ate, overwhelming prema rose within him, and he exclaimed, “Attention, all renunciants!

“Mother Śacī has cooked [various delicacies such as] mocā-ghaṇṭa (moist curry made with banana flowers), phula-baḓi (edible flowers dipped in batter and fried), ḍāli (dahl), ḍālnā (soup made with lentils and vegetables), and caccaḓi (dry curried vegetables). Seeing her pure devotion, Śrī Hari personally ate these [foodstuffs]. These rice and vegetable preparations are like ambrosia.

“Whatever results yogīs obtain by their practice of yoga will be obtained today by taking these remnants of the Lord. O brothers, simply chant, “Hari!” and eat. The three worlds are made glorious by the food remnants of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Having obtained these remnants, Śrī Tripurāri (Śiva) dances in ecstasy.”`
