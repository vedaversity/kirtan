    "en": `When will such a condition be mine? Upon renouncing my mundane desires and all varieties of bondage, I shall relinquish this dreadful material existence.

I shall construct a small hut in Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma, which is non-different from Śrī Vṛndāvana. Recognizing my relationship with Śrī Śacī-nandana, I shall take shelter of His lotus feet.

Sitting in a solitary place within a transcendental forest on the bank of the Jāhnavī River (Gaṅgā), I shall continuously drink the nectar of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s name. Chanting the name of Gaurāṅga, I shall call out:

“O Gaura-Nitāi! Both of You brothers are the friends of all fallen souls! I am the lowest of the low and very sinful, so please be an ocean of mercy to me.”

Weeping and weeping as I wander about the sixteen krośas (thirty-two square miles) of the dhāma, by both the Jāhnavī’s (Gaṅga’s) banks, I shall by some good fortune behold a vision beneath a tree.

“O Manohara (enchanter of my mind), what have I seen today?” Saying this, I shall faint. After regaining consciousness, I shall weep in secret, remembering that drop of Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi’s mercy.`
