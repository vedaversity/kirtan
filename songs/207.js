    "en": `By not worshiping my Lord Gaurasundara, I have invited death; and by neglecting the precious jewel of prema, I have lost it.

Attending to worthless trifles, I have thrown away my real wealth. I have drowned myself in my misdeeds.

Forsaking the association of devotees, I have sported with non-devotees. For this reason, I am being hung by the noose of my own actions.

I have constantly drunk the deadly poison of material sense enjoyment, and thus I have not become absorbed in the nectarean mellows (rasa) of gaura-kīrtana.

For what happiness does this life continue? Why doesn’t Narottama dāsa simply die?`
