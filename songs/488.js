    "en": `I will certainly perform with extreme diligence those acts that are favorable for bhakti to You.

Whatever in this world is favorable to bhakti, I will utilize by means of my physical senses.

I will listen to narrations of You with earnestness, and I will behold Your dhāma to the satisfaction of my eyes.

I will nourish my body with Your prasāda, and I will relish the fragrance of the tulasī that has adorned those offerings.

I will continuously perform service to You with my hands and will always reside in places within Your abode.

I will dovetail my desires in service to You and will display my anger to those who are envious of You.

In this way, may my every proclivity and every sentiment attain meaningfulness by being engaged favorably, in service to You.

Whatever I do that is favorable for Your bhaktas, I accept as favorable for bhakti to You.

Bhaktivinoda knows neither religion nor irreligion; may all his activities simply be favorable for bhakti.`
