    "en": `O my youthful Gaura! When will You mercifully reveal Yourself to me in the forest of Godruma, O thief of hearts?

You are situated inside Ānanda-sukhada-kuñja, with Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita at Your left. With a golden luster and curly hair, You wear the fine dress of a dancer.

As I gaze [upon You], Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava will appear and brilliantly illuminate the scene. Accompanied by all of Their sakhīs, They will dance, with enchanting garlands adorning Their necks.

Anaṅga Mañjarī, feeling compassion, will take this maidservant by the hand and lovingly offer me to the Divine Couple. I shall then behold Their sweetness to the full satisfaction of my eyes.`
