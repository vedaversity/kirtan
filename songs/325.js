bārabāra ei bāra laha nija sātha

bahu ʝoni bhrami’ nātha, lainu śaraṇa
nijaguṇe kṛpā kara adhamatāraṇa

jagata-kāraṇa tumi jagata-jīvana
tomā chāḍ̌ā kā’ra nahi, he rādhāramaṇa

bhuvanamaṅgala tumi bhuvanera pati
tumi upekṣile nātha ki haibe gati

bhāviẏā dekhinu ei jagata-mājhāre
tomā vinā keha nāhi e dāse uddhāre`,

    "en": `O Hari, O my merciful Rādhānātha, all glories to You! Again and again I have petitioned You, and now I beg You to take me into Your intimate company.

After wandering throughout many species of life, O Lord, I have taken shelter of You. Out of Your greatness, please be merciful and deliver this vile person.

You are the cause of the creation, and You are its very life. I am no one else’s but Yours, O Rādhā-ramaṇa!

You are the source of auspiciousness in the world, and You are the beneficent master of the world. If You forsake me, O Lord, then what will be my end?

I have come to the conclusion that in this material world there is no one but You to deliver this servant.`
