    "en": `When, before my very sight, will my bodily self-conception disappear? Then, with my own eyes I shall behold the exquisite beauty of Vraja, full of eternal spiritual cognizance and bliss.

At that time, I shall take birth in the village of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, and my marriage will occur in Yāvaṭa. My sole disposition and character will be that of a vraja-gopī. Any other mood will not remain.

When shall I obtain, by the power of Rādhā’s mercy, my perfected spiritual body, my perfected spiritual name, and my own form and dress—true initiation into the realm of kṛṣṇa-prema?

When I go to draw water from the Yamunā, I shall understand the confidential mellows of the Divine Couple’s loving affairs. Being overwhelmed with prema, I shall sing Śrī Rādhā’s glories just like a madwoman.`
