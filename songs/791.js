    "en": `Kṛṣṇa is the beloved of Rādhā, He is controlled by Rādhā, He is the Lord of all beauty, and His face resembles a kunda flower. He is the Lord of the gopīs, He bewilders Cupid, He delights in the rasa of the rāsa-līlā, and revels in amorous play at Rādhā-kuṇḍa’s Anaṅga-sukhada-kuñja. He gives pleasure to the cows, gopas, and gopīs.`
