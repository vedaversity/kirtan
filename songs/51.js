    "en": `Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s bodily complexion reproaches the luster of a fresh rain cloud, kājjala, and blue sapphires. His garments shine more than saffron, the rising sun, and a flash of lightning. His entire form is anointed with sandalwood mixed with camphor and saffron. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa (Son of the king of cowherds) bless me with service to His lotus feet.

On His cheeks dangle makara-shaped earrings that are most expert in dancing. His round face shatters the pride of the full moon and a host of lotuses. He tightens His shackles on the vraja-gopīs by eternally increasing their secret sentiments for Him. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

His beauty, attire, love-laden pastimes, and loving endeavors are all ever fresh and new. He is always surrounded by a group of friends who delight Him with their joking words as they play. The rays emanating from His pleasure forest (Śrī Vṛndāvana) defeat Indra’s heavenly Nandana Garden. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

Delighted by His friends, who are adorned with the gold of prema, He is honored by the lords of various planets (such as Indra), their heads touching the ground [in obeisance]. Yet He Himself daily worships brāhmaṇas and His gurus, at the appropriate times of day. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

He effortlessly cooled the heat of Indra and Kāliya-nāga and easily killed Kaṁsa and Vatsāsura. The rain of His playful pastimes nourishes His cātaka-bird-like (or one-pointed) devotees. He delights the vrajavāsīs with His valor, pure nature, and sweet pastimes. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

He satisfies Śrīmatī Rādhikā and the other gopīs with the nectar of His pastimes within the kuñjas and the nectar of rāsa-līlā. He nourishes Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Her sakhīs with His amorous pastimes and tricks, and He delights the heart of everyone with His prema, nature, playfulness, and fame. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

Through the rāsa-līlā, (which is free from any smell of mundane lust,) Śrī Kṛṣṇa shows the true path of pure bhakti to Him. With His charming beauty and attire, He churns the minds of those who churn minds (Cupids). Through the corners of His eyes, He intimates His moods to the gopīs. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

He is always eager to obtain the touch of Śrīmatī Rādhikā as She goes to pick flowers, and He is jubilant to receive darśana of the face of Rādhikā, who is so charming, with Her prema-laden crookedness. He is the enchanting sandal paste that adorns Rādhikā’s breasts. May that Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa bless me with service to His lotus feet.

Whoever sings this aṣṭaka prays to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the love of Rādhikā’s heart and whose darśana is not possible even for the celestial goddesses, headed by Lakṣmī. Thus he will please not only Him but also Rādhikā and Her companions, and Kṛṣṇa will engage such a devotee in service to His lotus feet in Śrī Vṛndāvana.`
