ʝāhā haite mile bhāi kṛṣṇa-premadhana

    "en": `Taking shelter of śrī guru, please worship his lotus feet, by which, O brother, the wealth of prema for Śrī Kṛṣṇa is attained.

To deliver the living entities, the son of Nanda Mahārāja, Śrī Hari, has manifested in the world by accepting the form of śrī guru.

Know that guru and Kṛṣṇa are one in their glories. Accept in your heart the order of śrī guru as the complete truth.

Whoever in true knowledge has faith in the words of śrī guru certainly attains residence in Śrī Vraja-bhūmi.

One with whom śrī guru is pleased does not become wearied by any obstacle whatsoever.

If Kṛṣṇa becomes angry [with you], then guru can save you; but if guru becomes angry, then even Kṛṣṇa cannot save you.

Guru is mother, guru is father, and guru is lord and master. Without śrī guru, there is no other shelter in this world.

Never consider śrī guru to be an ordinary human being and never hear any criticism of him.

Never look upon the face of one who criticizes śrī guru. Do not go to any place where criticism of śrī guru occurs.

If you ever see [apparently] aberrant behavior in śrī guru, still, do not neglect him at any time.

One whose devotion remains fixed at the lotus feet of śrī guru holds great power to deliver the universe.

Worship the lotus feet of such a guru, O brother, as they destroy all suffering.

I take upon my head in adoration the feet of one who always worships the lotus feet of śrī guru.

Aspiring within the heart to attain śrī guru’s lotus feet, Sanātana dāsa makes this prayer to him.`
