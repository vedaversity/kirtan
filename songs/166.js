    "en": `O Lord ! I am so unfortunate to have fallen into this material world, but You have sent an exalted soul, one of Your own associates, [to save me].

Being compassionate upon seeing me in such a fallen condition, he said, “O humbled soul, listen to this good advice by which your heart will become joyful.

“To deliver you, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya has descended to the land of Navadvīpa. He has conducted so many poor and lowly souls like you across the ocean of material existence.

“In order to fulfill the promise of the Vedas, He has appeared with a golden complexion as the son of a brāhmaṇa. Known by the name ‘Mahāprabhu’, He and His brother, the avadhūta Nityānanda, have caused all of Nadīyā to become maddened in divine ecstasy.

“Śrī Caitanya, who is directly the son of Nanda, has saved the world by distributing His own holy name. You go, also, and receive your deliverance.”

O Lord, hearing these words, Bhaktivinoda has come to Your lotus feet. Weeping, he tells the story of his life.`
