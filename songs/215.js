    "en": `Oh, tell me, when will that day be mine when my offenses will cease and a taste for the pure holy name will pervade my heart by the power of Your mercy?

When will I consider myself lower than a blade of grass and the quality of tolerance enter my heart? Giving respect to all and not desiring any respect for myself, I will taste the essence of the nectar of the holy names.

At that time, I will say that I do not want the bodily pleasures associated with wealth, followers, praise, and beautiful women. O Gaurahari! Birth after birth, give me selfless devotion (ahaitukī-bhakti) to Your lotus feet.

While uttering the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, when will my body horripilate in ecstasy, my words become choked with emotion, my complexion become pale, my body tremble, and streams of tears flow endlessly from my eyes?

When, in Navadvīpa, on the banks of the Suradhunī River (Gaṅgā), will I call out “O Gaura! O Nityānanda!” without duplicity? Dancing and singing, I shall run about like a madman, giving up any consideration [of the outside world].

When will Nityānanda Prabhu be merciful and free me from the illusion of material sense enjoyment? Bestowing upon me the shade of His lotus feet, He will give me the qualification to enter the marketplace of the holy name.

I will beg, borrow or steal the nectar of the holy name (harināma-rasa), by which I will become intoxicated and overwhelmed. Touching the feet of devotees who relish that rasa, I will continuously drown in it.

When will compassion for all living entities arise within me? At that time, forgetting my own happiness, and with a humble heart, this Bhaktivinoda will meekly wander about and propagate the sacred order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.`
