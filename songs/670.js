paharo pañcaraṅga sāḍ̌ī oḍ̌ho śyāma cadarā

jākī vaiẏā̐ gorī gorī pahare hāthana gajarā`,

    "en": `“O Rādhā, go and sit on the swing. Low rain clouds have come and filled the sky.

“Give up Your sulky mood, O friend. Don’t be stubborn like this. You are the dear, highly intelligent daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu.

“Decorate Yourself with sixteen kinds of ornaments and line your eyes with kajjal. Don your five-colored sārī and cover yourself with a thin, dark veil.

“Your playful beloved is waiting for You on the path. O Rādhā, wherever You place Your feet, Śyāma’s eyes follow.”

Silken ropes are hung, upon which fair Rādhā is swinging. Her golden arms are decorated with floral bracelets.`
