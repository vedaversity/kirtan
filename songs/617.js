    "en": `O brothers! Once, at the house of Gaurīdāsa Paṇḍit, Śrī Caitanya, Śrī Nityānanda, and Their devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, were relishing [various Bengali sweets such as] luci-cini (white-flour purīs dusted with sugar), kṣīra (sweetened condensed milk), sāra (thick cream), miṭhāi (sweet meats), pāyasa (sweet rice), and piṭhā-pānā (coconut cake rolls in sweetened condensed milk).

Mahāprabhu, feeling supreme bliss within His heart, ordered all devotees to eat. Blessed by taking Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s remnant grains, everyone chanted the holy names of Kṛṣṇa out loud.`
