    "en": `His lips are sweet, His face is sweet, His eyes are sweet, His smile is sweet, His heart is sweet, His gait is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His voice is sweet, His character is sweet, His attire is sweet, His speech is sweet, His movements are sweet, His wandering is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His flute is sweet, His foot-dust is sweet, His hands are sweet, His feet are sweet, His dancing is sweet, His friendship is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His singing is sweet, His drinking is sweet, His eating is sweet, His sleeping is sweet, His beauty is sweet, His tilaka is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His deeds are sweet, His acts of deliverance are sweet, His stealing is sweet, His amorous play is sweet, His yawning is sweet, and even His chastisements are sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His garland of guñja berries is sweet, His flower garland is sweet, His Yamunā River is sweet, and her waves, water, and lotuses are all sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His gopīs are sweet, His pastimes are sweet, His paraphernalia and ornaments are sweet, His food is sweet, His delight is sweet, His embrace is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.

His gopas are sweet, His cows are sweet, His staff is sweet, His act of creation is sweet, His defeat of demons is sweet, and His bestowal of fruits is sweet—everything is sweet about the original Lord of sweetness.`
