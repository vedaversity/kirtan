    "en": `O Śrīmatī Tulasī-devī, you are very dear to Kṛṣṇa. Desiring to attain eternal service to Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa (in Vraja), I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

Whoever takes shelter of you attains service to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Being merciful upon him, you make that person a resident of Vṛndāvana. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

I humbly clasp your lotus feet. May you make me your intimate follower. Keep me immersed in service to Śrī Gaurahari, day and night. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

It is the aspiration of this fallen soul that you grant me residence in Māyāpura, where I will always smear the dust of the holy abode on my body. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

For your ārati, I will beg incense, ghee lamp, and flowers. I now sing your glories, so please be happy with me. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

Of all the flowers within the universe, none is your equal. Forsaking them all, Kṛṣṇa performs pastimes only with your mañjarīs (and leaves). I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

O Vṛndā Mahārāṇī, bestower of kṛṣṇa-bhakti! The demigods and sages, along with all the holy places, joyfully reside at your feet. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.

Although Śrī Keśava is extremely fallen and devoid of sādhana and bhajana, having taken your shelter, he always floats in the bliss of the holy name. I repeatedly offer my obeisances unto you.`
