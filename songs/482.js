    "en": `Having submitted my soul at Your feet, I am supremely elated. Sorrow is banished and no anxieties remain. I see only bliss in the four directions.

Your two lotus feet are reservoirs of nectar that bestow freedom from lamentation and fear. Now, by taking refuge of them, I have given up the fear of worldly existence.

I shall serve in Your household, never partaking of the fruits [of my labor]. I shall diligently tend to Your satisfaction only, being fully dedicated to Your feet.

In the course of serving You, whatever difficulties may come are indeed the topmost joy. The pains and pleasures of service [to You] are the greatest assets, for they destroy the misery of nescience.

I have completely forgotten my past history, due to experiencing the joy of service to You. All I know is that I am Yours and You are mine. What need is there of any other treasure?

Bhaktivinoda, submerged in the ocean of bliss, devotes all his efforts in service to You and dwells in Your house, according to Your wishes.`
