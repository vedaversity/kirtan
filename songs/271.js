    "en": `The banks of Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa are made of transcendental desire-fulfilling gems. Nearby, there are hundreds and hundreds of beautiful kuñjas. The trees and creepers, which are made of coral, are weighty with an abundance of pearl-fruits.

A small cottage is beautifully situated within the enchanting grove known as Svānanda-sukhada-kuñja. Oh, when shall I sit there and sing the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, with the desire to attain His service?

At that time, the song of the transcendental flute will enter this maidservant’s ear. I shall become overwhelmed in ecstasy and forget everything, due to the song of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s flute.

Saying “Rādhe, Rādhe,” the flute will call the name of my worshipful mistress. Hearing that sound, this maidservant will jump up, startled and astonished, wondering how she shall live.`
