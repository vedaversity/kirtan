    "en": `I have finally understood, O Master, that Your lotus feet incessantly bestow utter ambrosia and complete freedom from fear and despair.

Leaving everything behind, I have fallen at Your lotus feet, O Lord.

Your lotus feet shall protect me, my guardian! There is no other protector within this material world.

I am Your eternal servitor; I realize this at long last. The burden of my upkeep is now Your concern.

I have suffered great despair in a life of independence. By accepting the shelter of Your lotus feet, however, all grief has been banished.

Those feet, for the sake of which Ramā-devī (the goddess of fortune) practices severe penance and attaining which Lord Śiva acquired his propitious nature (śivatva)…

…those feet, attaining which Lord Brahmā fulfilled the purpose of his existence and which Nārada Muni embraces in his heart…

…those very feet, the shelter of which award fearlessness, I bear upon my head. In supreme delight, I dance and sing of their virtues.

Your feet will certainly deliver this Bhaktivinoda from the calamities of worldly existence.`
