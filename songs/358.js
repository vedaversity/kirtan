    "en": `I am singing news of great happiness! At Surabhi-kuñja, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu has opened a marketplace of the holy name.

It is a matter of great bliss that He is selling the pure holy name at that marketplace for merely the price of one’s faith.

After examining the qualification of everyone in the assembly of devotees waiting to purchase the holy name, He bargains for the proper price with each person.

My dear brothers, if you want to purchase the pure holy name, then come with me to meet this magnanimous personality.

You will purchase the pure holy name, I shall take my due commission, and all our desires will be fulfilled.

Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu is extraordinarily merciful. Merely for the price of one’s faith, He bestows the topmost divine bliss.

If Nitāi only once sees tears welling in the eyes of someone chanting the name of Gaura, He gives His full support to that person.

He gives that person genuine teachings about Śrī Kṛṣṇa, not imposing any conditions in regard to caste, wealth, or strength of knowledge.

The snares of māyā are immediately released, so one may remain either at home [as a householder] or in the forest [as a renunciant], for no more troubles remain.

There is no longer any need to fear the age of Kali, for the munificent Nitāi gives the holy name to everyone—even to the lowest among men.

Bhaktivinoda loudly proclaims to all, “Besides the lotus feet of Śrī Nitāi-candra, there is no other shelter!”`
