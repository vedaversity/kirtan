    "en": `My desire for sense objects is a perversion of consciousness which constantly impells my heart to [want to] enjoy.

Oh, how much effort I have made, but my perversion has not gone. In the end, my life goes instead!

This frightful perversion has perturbed me. Because my heart is restless, peace finds no place there.

When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī bestow his mercy upon me and deliver me by investing me with yukta-vairāgya?

When will Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, out of great compassion, make me forsake sense gratification and then offer me to Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu?

When will Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, with the waters of conclusive truth, extinguish the fire of false arguments, which are burning my heart?

At that time, hearing the name of Śrī Caitanya will cause ecstatic horripilation in my body. By drinking the nectar of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, I shall become free from all grief.

This sinful person is the most wretched among the wretched. This destitute soul begs for shelter at the lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇavas.`
