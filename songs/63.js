    "en": `All glories to the prince of the cowherds! He is the blue sapphire necklace adorning the breast of Śrī Rādhā.

His limbs are anointed with kuṁkuma, saffron, and camphor, and His curly hair is bedecked with a peacock feather.

The shrill sound of His muralī flute shatters the composure of Śrī Rādhā, and His sidelong glance causes transformations of love to arise in Her.

He delights Śrī Rādhā’s sakhīs with rasa, and He revels in the heart of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī.`
