    "en": `O Gaurāṅga, do not fail to bestow Your mercy upon me. Making me Your own, keep me close to the reddish soles of Your lotus feet.

For Your lotus feet, I have renounced everything. Upon attaining those cooling lotus feet, I have taken shelter of them.

I have abandoned worldly [family] life, now and hereafter. Please keep me at Your lotus feet and call me Your own.

Grasping Your lotus feet, Vāsudeva Ghoṣa prays, “Kindly keep me here, forever giving me the shade of Your feet.”`
