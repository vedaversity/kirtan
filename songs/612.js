    "en": `On Ekādaśī, after decreeing hari-kīrtana, Mahāprabhu, who is the life and soul of the universe, begins to dance in ecstasy.

In the courtyard of the virtuous Śrīvāsa, the auspicious sounds of kīrtana—Gopāla! Govinda!—reverberates loudly.

The sounds of the mṛdaṅga, mandirā (small, cup-shaped cymbals), conch, and karatāla all blend nicely with the saṅkīrtana.

The thunderous sound penetrates the universe, filling the whole sky. Everything inauspicious in all four directions is annihilated.

At dawn, Viśvambhara dances while the [kīrtana] groups formed sing charmingly.

One group is with Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, and many others sing with Mukunda Datta.

There are many more with Govinda Ghoṣa. As Gaura-candra dances, everyone performs kīrtana.

The mighty Nityānanda Prabhu holds onto Mahāprabhu and gently strokes Him, while Advaita Ācārya secretly takes His foot dust.

Their eyes brimming with tears, Gadādhara and others become over­whelmed in transcendental happiness, due to Mahāprabhu’s kīrtana.

When Viśvambhara dances with great force, the Earth trembles and everyone becomes afraid.

Sometimes Viśvambhara dances so sweetly that He appears to be the son of Nanda, the best of dancers.

Their eyes filled with joy, Mahāprabhu’s servants observe His unprecedented love for Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His incomparably beautiful dancing.

Mahāprabhu Viśvambhara dances, rejoicing in His own trans­cendental happiness. The rhythmic sound of His lotus feet is extremely captivating.

Under the weight of His ecstatic emotions, His garland is unable to remain around His neck. Breaking apart, it falls at the feet of the devotees.

The auspiciousness of śrī harināma saṅkīrtana spreads in all four directions as the son of Jagannātha Miśra dances in the midst [of the devotees].

Absorbed in the bliss of Śrī Hari’s name, Śiva becomes oblivious to his own clothing. He whose glories impel Śiva to dance in ecstasy also dances Himself.

By His name, Vālmīki achieved the wealth of austerity, and by His name, Ajāmila received deliverance.

By hearing His name, the bindings of the material world are destroyed. That Lord, having descended, dances in the age of Kali.

His name is chanted by Śukadeva and Nārada as they wander about. His glories are sung by the Lord of innumerable mouths [Śrī Anantadeva].

His name constitutes the highest form of atonement. That Lord dances while those who are supremely fortunate look on.

Seeing Mahāprabhu’s transcendental bliss, the associates of the Lord embrace each other and weep.

Sandal paste and garlands grace everyone’s bodies. They sing in great bliss, forgetting their own selves, due to immersion in kṛṣṇa-rasa.

Entranced in kīrtana, all the Vaiṣṇavas lose complete sense of their own bodies and of everyone around them.

Delighted, everyone sings day and night, “Jaya Kṛṣṇa, Murāri, Mukunda, Vanamālī!”

Day and night, Viśvambhara dances with the devotees, but they never become fatigued, because their bodies are fully transcendental.

In such a manner, Mahāprabhu Viśvambhara dances the entire night, except for one prahara [during which He sleeps].

In this way, transcendental happiness arises in the land of Navadvīpa as the hero of Vaikuṇṭha sports in prema-rasa.

Gaura-candra and His associates remain in the hearts of those who hear this entire auspicious description.

Vṛndāvana dāsa offers this song at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and the moon-like Nityānanda Prabhu.`
