    "en": `O Radha and Krsna, this person presents an appeal before you.  You are both very charming and full of nectar, and Your hearts are full of compassion.  My Lords, please listen to my request.

O dark-complexioned Krsna, O moon of Gokula, O lover of the gopis, O golden-complexioned Radha, O crest jewel of the gopis who are so dear to Krsna, when I hear the glories of Your transcendental virtues my heart becomes pacified.

Hearing from the devotees' mouths that You are very merciful to the fallen and miserable, I joyfully take shelter of You.  If You neglect me I have no place to go.

O Radha, all glories to You.  O Krsna all glories to You.  O Radha and Krsna all glories to You.  O Krsna, O Krsna, all glories to You.  O Radha, all glories to You.  Narottama dasa places His folded hands upon his head and falls to the ground before You.  Please fulfill the desires of his heart.`
