    "en": `All glories to Śrī Rādhā, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and the divine forest of Śrī Vṛndāvana. All glories to Śrī Govinda, Gopīnātha, and Madana-mohana [the three presiding deities of Vṛndāvana].

All glories to Śyāma-kuṇḍa, Rādhā-kuṇḍa, and Govardhana Hill. All glories to the river Yamunā (Kālindī) and to the great forest known as Gokula Mahāvana [where Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma performed Their childhood pastimes].

All glories to Keśī-ghāṭa [where Kṛṣṇa killed the Keśī demon], Vaṁśīvaṭa [the banyan tree that Krsna stood under and attracted the gopīs by playing His flute], and to the twelve forests of Vraja, where the son of Nanda performed His pastimes.

All glories to Śrī Nanda and Śrī Yaśodā [Kṛṣṇa’s father and mother]. All glories to the cowherd boys, headed by Śrīdāma [the older brother of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Anaṅga Mañjarī]. All glories to the cows and calves of Vraja.

All glories to Śrī Vṛṣabhānu and the beautiful Kīrtidā [Rādhārāṇī’s father and mother]. All glories, all glories to Paurṇamāsī [the guru of the cowherd community; the mother of Sāndīpani Muni; the grandmother of Madhumaṅgala and Nāndī-mukhī; and the disciple of Devarṣi Nārada]. All glories to the damsels of Vraja.

All glories, all glories to Gopīśvara Śiva, who resides within Vṛndāvana [to protect the holy dhāma]. All glories, all glories to Kṛṣṇa’s young brāhmaṇa friend, Madhumaṅgala.

All glories to Rāma-ghāṭa [where Balarāma peformed His rāsa dance]. All glories to Balarāma, the son of Rohiṇī. All glories, all glories to all the residents of Vṛndāvana.

All glories to the wives of the proud Vedic brāhmaṇas and to the wives of the serpent Kālīya, all of whom attained the lotus feet of Govinda through pure bhakti.

All glories to the circular arena of the rāsa dance. All glories to Rādhā and Śyāma. All glories, all glories to the most beautiful rāsa-līlā.

All glories, all glories to ujjvala-rasa (śṛṅgāra-rasa), which is the essence and most excellent of all rasas and which is known as the parakīya-bhāva of Vraja.

Remembering the lotus feet of Śrī Jāhnavā-devī [Nityānanda Prabhu’s consort], this fallen Kṛṣṇadāsa performs nāma-saṅkīrtana.`
