    "en": `O mind, why do you not worship Śrī Gaura, the best of all incarnations? You always stay in water, but your thirst is never satiated. This is the consequence of your own activities.

O mind, you always serve thorn trees with the hope of obtaining nectarean fruits. My Gaurāṅga is a wish-fulfilling tree of prema, but you consider Him to be poison.

O mind, searching for a sweet fragrance, you smell the palāśa flower [which has no scent], and an insect has entered your nose. You suck on dry wood, mistaking it for sugar cane, so how can you get any sweetness?

O mind, thinking it to be a necklace, you have put around your neck a snake that is the servant of Yama. You basked in fire, thinking it to be cool, and thus you suffer excruciating heat.

O mind, you worship material existence, forgetting Śrī Gaurāṅga, and you fail to heed the advice of devotees. You have wasted both this life and the next, and thus you have destroyed your own self.`
