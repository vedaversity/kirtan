    "en": `If you wish to vanquish the dog-like personality of Kali, then sing the name of Śrī Śacīnandana, the savior of the age of Kali who nullifies all fear of Kali.

Gaura is the exhilaration of Gadādhara Paṇḍita. He is the treasure of the life of Nityānanda Prabhu and the worshipful object of Advaita Ācārya. He is known as Nimāi, Viśvambhara, the Lord of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, and He who steals the hearts of the devotees.

He is the moon of Nadīyā, the Lord of Māyāpura, and the divine propagator of the holy name. For gṛhāstas, He is the instructor, and for renunciants, He is their hero. He is Mādhava in the bhāva of Śrī Rādhā.

He is the purifier of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, the savior of King Pratāparudra, the nurturer of Rāmānanda Rāya, and a great hero. He enhances the bliss of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, and he is the maintainer of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī. He is the delight of Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and He is very grave.

He is immersed in vraja-rasa,. He is the destroyer of wicked materialistic philosophies, the purger of hypocrisy [from the heart], and is the transcendental Kāmadeva (Cupid). He nourishes the pure devotees, expels dry knowledge, demolishes false bhakti, and is the reservoir of all pleasure.`
