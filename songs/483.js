    "en": `O youthful son of the king of Vraja, You are the Lord of all lords. In accord with Your will, universal creation and destruction take place.

In accord with Your will, Lord Brahmā creates, and in accord with Your will, Lord Viṣṇu maintains.

In accord with Your will, Lord Śiva destroys, and in accord with Your will, Māyā-devī constructs the prison house of this world.

In accord with Your will, the living beings take birth and die, and in accord with Your will, they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.

The living being, bound by illusory māyā, simply wanders hither and thither. Without Your will, he cannot accomplish anything.

You are my only protector and maintainer. Except for Your lotus feet, there is no hope for me.

Having given up faith in my own strength and endeavors, I am solely dependent upon Your will.

Bhaktivinoda is very lowly and poor. According to Your will, he lives and dies.`
