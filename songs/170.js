ei se pūrave chila gokulera gopāla

keha bale,—‘jānakī-vallabha chila rāma’
keha bale,—‘nandalāla navaghana-śyāma’

pūrave kāliẏā chila gopīpreme bhorā
bhāviẏā rādhāra varaṇa ebe haila gorā

chala chala aruṇa naẏāna anurāgī
nā pāiẏā bhāvera ora haila vairāgī

sannyāsī vairāgī haiẏā bhrame deśe deśe
tamu nā pāila rādhāra premera uddeśe

govinda dāsiẏā kaẏa kiśorī kiśorā
svarūpa-rāmera sane sei rase bhorā`,

    "en": `In His previous birth Saci's son, fair Sri Krishna Caitanya, was a cowherd boy in Gokula.

Some say He was Janaki's beloved, Lord Ramacandra. Others say He was Nanda's son, dark like a monsoon cloud.

In ancient times He was dark, but now, overcome by personally experiencing the love the gopis feel for Him, He became fair like Sri Radharani.

Tears flowed from His reddened eyes. He could not find the limit of that ecstatic love. He renounced everything.

He renounced everything, accepted sannyasa, and wandered from place to place. He tried to understand Radha's love, but He could not.

Govinda dasa says: It was in the company of Svarupa Damodara and Ramananda Raya that Lord Caitanya, overwhelmed, tasted the nectar of ecstatic love for Sri Sri Kisori-Kisora, the teenage divine couple.`
