    "en": `One who has failed to worship with great care Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s lotus feet, which are the treasure-house of all auspiciousness; who has not taken shelter of that abode called Śrī Vṛndāvana, which is decorated with the imprints of Rādhā’s lotus feet…

…and who in this life has not associated with the devotees of Śrīmatī Rādhikā—whose moods are deep and grave and whose heart is extremely sober—how will such a person ever experience the bliss of bathing in the ocean of the rasa of ecstatic love for Śrī Śyāmasundara? Please understand this most carefully.

Śrīmatī Rādhikā is the ācārya of ujjvala-rasa (the resplendent mellows of amorous love). The pure prema between Rādhā and Mādhava is meant to be contemplated and discussed.

One who takes hold of Śrī Rādhā’s lotus feet with great care obtains the priceless jewel of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.

Without the lotus feet of Śrī Rādhā, one can never attain Śrī Kṛṣṇa. All the Vedic scriptures declare that Kṛṣṇa belongs to the maidservants of Rādhā.

Relinquishing wealth, followers, wife, sons, and friends, and giving up materialistic activities and speculative knowledge, one should become absorbed in the sweetness of sevā to Śrī Rādhā’s lotus feet. This is Bhaktivinoda’s conviction.`
