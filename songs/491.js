    "en": `Whatever [so-called] dharma exists in opposition to the edicts of bhakti, I will most carefully relinquish.

I will never keep the company of those neglectful of bhakti to You, and I will never glance upon the face of persons averse to Śrī Gaurāṅga.

I will never make my residence in any place that is detrimental to bhakti, and I will never develop attachment for any work that is disagreeable to bhakti.

I will never read any literature that contradicts the doctrine of bhakti, and I will never hear any discourse that opposes bhakti.

I do not regard any place unrelated to Śrī Gaurāṅga to be a tīrtha (holy place). I consider any karma or jñāna that impedes bhakti to be most trivial.

I never celebrate any occasion that hinders bhakti. I consider any relatives who are oblivious to bhakti to be strangers.

I will give up any desires that impede bhakti. I will never accept foodstuffs given by non-devotees.

Whatever I know to be unfavorable to bhakti, I will carefully forsake. This is my spoken promise.

Falling at the lotus feet of the Lord, Bhaktivinoda begs for the strength to relinquish everything unfavorable to pure devotion.`
