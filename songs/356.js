    "en": `“Wake up, sleeping souls! Wake up, sleeping souls!” calls Śrī Gaura-candra. “How long will you sleep in the lap of the witch Māyā?

“You came into this material world saying you will worship the Lord, but, having forgotten this, you remain burdened by ignorance.

“It is only to deliver you that I have descended. Who but Me is your friend?

“I have brought the medicine that will destroy [the disease of] māyā. Take these holy names, I beg you!”

Falling at the lotus feet of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, Bhaktivinoda has begged for and accepted this harināma-mantra.`
