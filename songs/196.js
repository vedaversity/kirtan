    "en": `O Gaura, Lord of prema! What shall I tell You of the sufferings of my life, O Master? I have lost my true self.

What more shall I say? O Lord, after so long, to speak of the purpose for which You brought me to the world, I become weary with lamentation and sorrow.

Attachment to bhajana of You has not awakened within me, I am intoxicated by the mundane and the illusory, and my intelligence is always wicked. By remaining near sense enjoyers, I have become just like them.

Who am I? Why have I come here? My mind never ponders these questions. Sometimes enjoying and sometimes renouncing, my mind only dances in beguilement.

I never contemplate what my outcome will be. I do not even go near the devotees of Hari. All the inauspicious symptoms of one who opposes Hari are within me.

By śrī guru’s grace my illusory dream has been broken. I now understand that You alone are mine and that Your associates are my greatest friends in this prison house of material existence.

I will not worship anything besides the feet of Your devotees. I have taken shelter of the crimson soles of Your lotus feet. O Lord! Rescue me from māyā’s entangling net by pulling this servant by the hair.

Do you not deliver the sinners? Jagāi and Mādhāi were sinners [and you delivered them], so, Lord of prema, I know that it's true, you do indeed deliver the sinners [like myself].

I am devoid of bhakti, wretched and destitute. Place both Your lotus feet upon the head of this offender. At Your beautiful feet, which instill fearlessness, I take eternal shelter.`
