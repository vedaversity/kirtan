    "en": `Just worship Śrī Gaurahari, who is very affectionate to His devotees. He is that very Kṛṣṇa who roams the pasturing grounds of Vṛndāvana with His cows and who steals the hearts of Nanda Mahārāja and Mother Yaśodā.

[Mother Yaśodā calls,] “O Dāmodara, it is very late. Please come right now. Sit down in the dining hall and take Your meal.”

At the instruction of Nanda Bābā, Kṛṣṇa, the lifter of Govardhana Hill, sits down with Baladeva and Their friends in rows to take lunch.

They are served a feast of śuktā (bitter stew), various kinds of śāk (leafy vegetable preparations), bhāji (fried savories), nālitā (a jute leaf preparation), kuṣmāṇḍa (a pumpkin preparation), ḍāli (chewable sticks), ḍālnā (curry), dugdha-tumbī (gourd boiled in milk), yogurt, and mocā-khaṇḍa (curry of banana flower fritters).

There is mudga-baḓā (mung dahl fritters), māṣa-baḍā (urad dahl fritters), flat bread, ghṛtānna (rice with ghee), śaṣkulī (a preparation made with rice-flour and sesame seeds), piṭhe (varieties of rice-flour cakes and dumplings), khīra (sweetened condensed milk), pulī (rice-flour dumplings in sweetened condensed milk), and pāyasānna (sweet rice).

They are given karpūra amṛta-keli (ambrosial milk sweets scented with camphor), rambhā (banana sweets), khīra-sāra (condensed cream [rabaḍī]), amṛta-rasālā (juicy nectarean sweets), and twelve kinds of sour chutneys.

There is luci-cini (white-flour purīs dusted with sugar), sarpurī (cream cakes), lāḍḍu (sweet balls), and rasābalī (dahl patties boiled in sugar-water). Kṛṣṇa eats all the preparations with great delight.

In supreme bliss, Kṛṣṇa takes the rice and various types of vegetables cooked by Rādhikā.

Madhumaṅgala takes lāḍḍus by hook or by crook, and he makes a funny sound by putting his hand under his armpit and flapping his arm as he calls out, “Haribol!”

Glancing at Rādhikā and Her sakhīs out of the corner of His eye, Kṛṣṇa takes His lunch at Mother Yaśodā’s house with great satisfaction.[Now offer to Gurudeva, Vrajavāsīs, and Vaiṣṇavas]

After finishing His meal, Kṛṣṇa drinks rose-scented water. Then all the sakhās, standing in lines, wash their mouths.

After washing their hands and mouths, all the sakhās blissfully take rest along with Baladeva.

The sakhās Jāmbula and Rasāla bring Kṛṣṇa spiced betel nuts. After chewing them, Kṛṣṇa-candra happily goes to sleep.

While His servant Viśālākṣa waves a peacock-feather fan to cool Him, Kṛṣṇa sleeps contentedly upon His very beautiful bed.

Upon Mother Yaśodā’s request, Rādhā joyfully relishes the remnants of Kṛṣṇa’s plate, brought to Her by Dhaniṣṭhā.

Receiving Her remnants, Lalitā and the other sakhīs happily sing the glories of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa within their minds.

This Bhaktivinoda, whose joy is only found in the pastimes of Hari, sings this bhoga-ārati song.`
