    "en": `After attaining this rare human birth in the material world, I have not worshiped Śrī Kṛṣṇa. To whom shall I tell my sorrows?

By my engaging in worldly activities, time has passed in vain. There was no benefit; rather, only trouble arose.

What kind of world is this? It is like a magic lantern show [full of shadows and illusions]. By my being attached to this world, days pass in futility.

When this body dies, what will remain mine? No one, including my sons and family members, will be able to give me happiness then.

Like an ass, I work very hard, but for whom do I labor so? My illusion has not been removed.

My days pass in useless work, and my nights pass under the control of sleep. I never think that death is sitting nearby.

I eat, see, and wear whatever—good or bad—free from anxiety. I never think that one day I will give up this body.

Thoughts of my body, house, wife, and other possessions are constantly appearing in my heart, destroying my intelligence.

Alas! Alas! I never think that all these things are temporary. When this life ends, where will my material opulence go?

My body will lie in the crematorium, and vultures and insects will sport there.

All the dogs and jackals will happily partake of a huge feast—my body.

Such is the destination of the material body and all the worldly opulences, friends [and family] that follow it.

Therefore, those who are intelligent give up their infatuation with illusion and pursue the eternal truth of kṛṣṇa-bhakti.`
