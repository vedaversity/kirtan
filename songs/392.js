    "en": `O Hari! Having fallen into the material world of five elements and become helpless, I see no solace other than the shelter of Your feet, for You are the resort of the helpless. I have made You my all in all.

Good works and wisdom—I possess neither. Nor can I perform sādhana-bhajana. You are benevolent, and I am lowly; therefore, I seek Your causeless grace.

The urges of speech, the mind, anger, the tongue, the belly, and the genitals, having assembled together, have set me adrift in the ocean of worldly life and are causing me excruciating anxiety.

In trying to diligently subdue these urges, I have simply abandoned hope. O Lord of the shelterless, I call Your name, for now You are my only hope.`
