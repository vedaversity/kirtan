...who resolutely protects in every way the mission to fulfill the heartfelt desires of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. Being non-different from Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, he is the cause of the fallen souls’ deliverance.

He is more devastating than a thunderbolt in eradicating unauthorized philosophical conclusions, he is fearless in establishing the truth, and he removes all detrimental association.

He is a thoroughly transcendental personality, and he nurtures with great affection those who have taken shelter of him. He is always aggrieved to see the suffering of the conditioned jīvas, and he bestows prema for the glorious holy name.

He is a direct manifestation of Śrī Viṣṇu’s lotus feet, and his only engagement is in fulfilling the desires of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is immersed in meditation on Śrī Gaurāṅga, and he always keeps his own guru within his heart.

Through his loving vision, he sees the presence of Viṣṇu everywhere. I offer praṇāma to Śrī Gurudeva, who is the embodiment of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s eminence.

He established Śrī Gauḓīya Vedānta Samiti, and he greatly enhanced the service to Śrī Māyāpura-dhāma.

I offer praṇāma to Śrīla Gurudeva, who perennially protects the parikramā of Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma and is forever merciful to fallen persons.

O Gurudeva, please bestow your mercy upon this forlorn person, who always desires it in all respects, so that I may remain forever immersed in meditation on your lotus feet.`
