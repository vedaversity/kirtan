    "en": `Śrī Nitāi-candra is the root of divine bliss. His eyes, which are the color of a crimson sunrise, overflow with a desire to bestow mercy. He is an abode of mercy. From Him a stream of compassion ceaselessly flows as He sweetly sings, “Hari! Hari!”

While enjoying spectacular dancing in the company of His devotees, Nitāi floats in multicolored waves of rasa. He smiles gently, speaks sweetly, and moves His neck to and fro.

Remaining absorbed in bliss day and night, He embraces the fallen while chanting the names of Gaura. With great vigor, He distributes the treasure of prema to the people of the world.

In the midst of kīrtana, Śrī Nitāi-candra, the king of rasikas, is like a golden mountain. He spreads the rasa of the playful pastimes of Vraja through His sweet, sweet singing.

Overwhelmed with prema, sometimes He rolls on the earth, covering Himself with ashen-grey dust. Sometimes He wanders restlessly, sometimes He plays, and sometimes He laughs very loudly.

Sometimes He perspires, sometimes He laments, sometimes He experiences horripilation, and sometimes He stammers. Sometimes He leaps long distances, sometimes He jumps high into the air, and sometimes He heaves deep sighs.

He is the ocean of mercy, the friend of all, and the full moon dissipating the darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali. By removing the cataracts of illusion from the eyes of the residents of this world, Śrī Nitāi has fulfilled their desires.

By bestowing prema, He has delivered the blind, the fallen, the destitute, and the wicked. The whole world has been delivered; only this Rādhā-vallabha dāsa has been deprived.`
