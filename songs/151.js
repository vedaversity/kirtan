    "en": `All glories, all glories to Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the son of Rohiṇī. To deliver the fallen souls, He extends His two arms.

With a choked voice, He stammers sweetly. Whomever He sees, He lovingly embraces.

Overflowing with prema, His eyes always roll about restlessly, looking like bumblebees hovering over a golden lotus.

The merciful Lord, Śrī Nitāi, knows the sufferings of others. He has strung together a garland of the holy names, which He has bestowed upon the people of this world.

He has subdued the sinners and the atheists, but He has distributed prema to the poor and the lowly.

Calling out, “Alas, O Gaurāṅga!” He falls to the earth. Nitāi’s whole body becomes soaked with the tears from His eyes.

Within his heart, Vṛndāvana dāsa considers Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu to be like Mount Sumeru falling upon the earth.`
