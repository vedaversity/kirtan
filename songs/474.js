parihāre pāi lajjā, saba jāna’ tumi

tumi vinā kā’ra āmi laiba śaraṇa ?
tumi sarveśvareśvara vrajendranandana

jagat tomāra nātha! tumi sarvamaẏa
tomā-prati aparādha tumi kara’ kṣaẏa

tumi ta’ skhalita-pada janera āśraẏa
tumi vinā āra kevā āche, daẏāmaẏa

seirūpa tava aparādhī jana ʝata
tomāra śaraṇāgata haibe satata

tuẏā pade kare āja ātmasamarpaṇa`,

    "en": `I make this submission at Your feet, O Lord. I am lowly and wretched. This is known throughout the three worlds.

There is no sinner like me in this world; there is no offender like me in all of existence.

I feel shame even in casting off all these sins and offenses, for You know everything [about how vast and egregious are my wrongdoings].

In whom shall I seek refuge other than You? You are the Lord of lords, O Vrajendra-nandana!

The world is Yours, O Master, and You encompass everything. Absolve me of my offenses to You!

You are the sanctuary of those who have faltered. O Benevolent One, who is there but You?

All such offenders to You shall always [come to a point of] surrender to You.

Thus, Bhaktivinoda, surrendering at Your feet, now offers You his very self.`
