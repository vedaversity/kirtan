    "en": `O venerable Vaiṣṇavas, give me your mercy! Holding a straw between my teeth, this wretched and sinful person petitions you.

Make me fortunate by helping me attain the lotus feet of śrī guru and Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.

Without the mercy of you all, this is unattainable. I say with certainty that I, especially, am unqualified.

You are all wish-fulfilling trees and oceans of mercy. This [attaining your mercy] is the only hope I hold within my heart.

I do not possess an iota of good qualities, and there is no limit to my offenses. Show the people of this world your glories by delivering me.

Please show your great compassion by bestowing a taste for nāma-saṅkīrtana and the treasure of prema upon this Rādhā-mohana dāsa.`
