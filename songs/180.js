kahe premānanda,    emana gaurāṅge,
rati nā janmila mora`,

    "en": `There is no one like Gaurāṅga! No other incarnation, past, present, or future, has preached such a rare form of prema.

He has not slain the very wicked or the fallen atheists. Instead, He has purified everyone’s hearts by going from door to door, freely giving them the holy name.

He has poured over the whole world the prema that is desired by even Śiva and Brahmā. The destitute, upon receiving and drinking this prema, begin to dance and clap their hands with joy.

Laughing and weeping, they roll upon the ground in prema, and the limbs of their bodies manifest horripilation. Even the caṇḍālas (dog-eaters) and brāhmaṇas embrace one another. Oh, has there ever been such a wondrous spectacle?

With calls and cries, with mṛdaṅga and karatālas, He and His devotees sing and run hither and thither. Seeing this, Yamarāja (the lord of death) has become frightened and closed his door.

The three worlds have become filled with bliss upon the auspicious uproar of kīrtana. Premānanda dāsa laments, “Oh, rati (affection) for that Gaurāṅga has not appeared in my heart!”`
