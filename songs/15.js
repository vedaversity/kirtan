    "en": `The sphere of His bright face resembles a wandering autumnal moon, His pure complexion glistens, His gait is like that of an elephant, He is utterly intoxicated in kṛṣṇa-prema, and He is the personification of pure spiritual energy (viśuddha-sattva). His face is smiling, His eyes are ever rolling, His hand holds a staff, and (by the performance of nāma-saṅkīrtana) He dispels the forces of Kali. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

He is the abode of all rasas, He is everything to His devotees, He is beyond compare, and He is the dear husband of Vasudhā and Jāhnavā-devī, who are His very life. He is always maddened in prema, and He is unknown only to those of mundane intelligence. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

He is most dear to Mother Śacī’s son, He is worshiped by the entire universe, and He is forever filled with joy. By His unbounded mercy, He rescues the souls drowning in this age of Kali, and by performing śrī harināma-saṅkīrtana, He evaporates the swelling pride in this ocean of mundane existence. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

“O My brother [Gaurāṅga], contaminated by the vices of Kali-yuga, what will become of mankind?” He thus advises the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, “Please devise a purificatory method whereby they can easily attain Your shelter.” I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

“O brothers, simply chant incessantly the names of Śrī Hari, and let the responsibility of delivering you from the ocean of repeated birth and death rest upon Me.” While traveling constantly, He approached the door of every home, declaring this with outstretched arms. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

How astonishing! He is [just like] Agastya Muni [who once swallowed the entire ocean], forcibly swallowing the ocean of repeated birth and death. He is the rising moon that causes the ocean of saintly persons’ good fortune to swell. He is the brilliant sun, blazing before the multitude of rogues and dispelling the darkness of their ignorance. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

Dancing, singing, and calling out the names of Śrī Hari, He roams  each and every path, and inspires the passerby and His own people to sing and dance. He casts upon the saintly a glance from the corners of His merciful eyes. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

He gently held the supremely soft lotus hand of His brother, Their hearts soaring upward in the highest bliss as They gazed at each others’ faces. As He wandered here and there, He delighted the townspeople with His sweetness. I perpetually worship Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, the root of the kṛṣṇa-bhakti tree.

May Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu’s two lotus feet brilliantly manifest in the hearts of those who recite this unprecedented and supremely potent Nityānandāṣṭakam, which is the reservoir of rasa, the treasure of exalted rasika Vaiṣṇavas, and the abode of the essence of bhakti-rasa. It bestows liberation upon all fallen souls who simply remember it.`
