    "en": `O Hari! Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in the form of śrī guru, whispered this advice into my ear: “Understand my words, O beggar of nāma, and you will attain rati (affection) for chanting the name.

“Very carefully engage your tongue and mind in Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s name, form, attributes, and pastimes, in accordance with the gradual method [given in the scriptures].

“Residing in Vraja as a rāgānuga-bhakta, engage in smaraṇa and kīrtana of the Lord. Indeed, spend all your time in this way. Accept this as the essence of all instructions.”

Alas! O Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, when will you mercifully bestow residence in Vraja upon this wretched soul? You are rāgātmikā , and the wish of this servant is to follow in your footsteps.`
