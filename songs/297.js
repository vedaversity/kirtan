    "en": `O sakhī! What have I seen today? In a kadamba grove on the banks of the Yamunā, a beautiful blackish flute player, seated upon a jeweled platform, is performing His pastimes as the king of all rasa.

The amorous pastimes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa are just like a waterfall of nectar. Situated upon the eight petals [of the jeweled throne] are Śrī Rādhā and Śrī Hari, surrounded by Their attendants, the eight principal sakhīs.

By singing sweet songs and dancing gracefully, all the sakhīs satisfy their treasured Divine Couple. Beholding Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, the beautiful spiritual energy expands the splendor of the Vṛndāvana forest.

To relish the nectar of such pastimes, I will not go home but will enter the forest instead. Renouncing all shyness due to fear of family and society, just worship the king of Vraja. This is the humble entreaty of Bhaktivinoda.`
