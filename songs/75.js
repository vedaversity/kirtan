    "en": `May I not achieve mystic perfections, liberation, residence in Vaikuṇṭha-loka as a personal associate of Nārāyaṇa, or even prema for the Lord. Rather, may I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Where Brahmā prayed to take birth as grass, as did the crest-jewel among pure devotees, Uddhava, after beholding the pinnacle of sweetness—may I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

“O Pṛthvī-devī, what austerities did you perform whereby your surface has now become marked by the lotus footprints of Śrī Kṛṣṇa?” The gopīs thus praised the glory of the earth [of Vṛndāvana]. May I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Where there are amorous pleasures with the gopīs, in which rasa [in the parakīya relationship] reaches its pinnacle, for the Śrutis say, ''Indeed, He is the embodiment of rasa''. May I therefore reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Although [appearing to be] five yojanas (forty square miles) and within three boundaries—Bhāṇḍīravaṭa, Govardhana, and the rāsa-sthalī—Vṛndāvana is in fact limitless, being all-pervading. May I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Where the daughter of Vṛṣabhāṇu Mahārāja has full sovereignty, and by whose influence the happiness of prema arises within the devotees—may I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

The great and delightful rāsa-līlā, which Lakṣmī-devī with all her austerities could not attain, is splendidly performed within the multitude of charming kuñjas of Vṛndāvana. May I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Where varieties of deer, headed by the ruru [which are black in color] and the nyaṅku [with their branching horns], fearlessly play, where cuckoos, bumblebees, and parrots fill the sky with their singing, and where peacocks perpetually dance—may I reside only in Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma.

Those with fixed intelligence who loudly recite these eight verses glorifying Śrī Vṛndāvana shall attain direct service to the lotus feet of the Lord and Lady of Vṛndāvana at the end of this life.`
