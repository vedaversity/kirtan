    "en": `After the killing of Ariṣṭāsura, Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Her sakhīs exchanged many joking words with Śrī Kṛṣṇa concerning the necessary atonement for one who has committed the offence of killing a bull. As a result, the Queen of Vṛndāvana, Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and Her sakhīs joyfully excavated and filled Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa with their own hands. May that immensely fragrant Rādhā-kuṇḍa be my shelter.

In the land of the hearts of those who bathe in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, a desire tree of the superlative prema, which is not attainable even for Kṛṣṇa’s principal queens in Dvārakā, will arise. May that supremely charming Rādhā-kuṇḍa be my shelter.

For the pleasure of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, even Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, yearning to attain Her merciful sidelong glance, regularly bathes in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, carefully observing all the appropriate rituals. May that supremely enchanting Rādhā-kuṇḍa be my shelter.

May that supremely enchanting Rādhā-kuṇḍa, which the moon of Vraja, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, loves as much as He loves the crown-jewel amongst the sweet girls of Vraja, Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and which He has made known by the name of Rādhikā Herself, be my shelter.

The mercy obtained by serving Rādhā-kuṇḍa makes the desire-creeper of prema for the prince of Vraja sprout and is celebrated for bearing the flower of service to my svāminī Śrīmatī Rādhikā. May that supremely charming Rādhā-kuṇḍa be my shelter.

Gloriously manifest on the banks of Rādhā-kuṇḍa are eight kuñjas named after Rādhikā’s principal sakhīs. Filled with the sweet humming of bumblebees, these kuñjas act as stimuli for the amorous pastimes of the Divine Couple. The lotus feet of that Rādhikā, who sends Kṛṣṇa to enjoy in all the different kuñjas, are desired by everyone. May that supremely enchanting Rādhā-kuṇḍa be the shelter of my life.

Situated on an exquisite dais on the bank of Rādhā-kuṇḍa and accompanied by Her beloved sakhīs, our svāminī Śrīmatī Rādhikā charmingly engages in sweet, joking words with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the moon of Vraja. These playful verbal exchanges are enhanced by the suggestion of so many innuendoes. May that Rādhā-kuṇḍa be the shelter of my life.

May that very charming and especially fragrant Rādhā-kuṇḍa, where intoxicated with love the Divine Couple and the sakhīs daily cavort with great joy in the water so fragrant with exquisite lotus flowers, be the sole shelter of my life.

To that devotee who, in a resolute mood of aspiring to serve Śrīmatī Rādhikā, reads this charming prayer describing Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa, even in their present body Śrī Kṛṣṇa will quickly grant them darśana of not only His beloved Rādhikā, but also of Their many variegated amorous pastimes. Witnessing these pastimes and envisioning himself serving Yugala-kiśora in various ways, such a devotee will feel immense jubilation.`
