    "en": `O worshipful Vaiṣṇavas, I humbly submit this prayer to you. I am an extremely fallen and wicked soul, and my fate is causing me to drown in the terrible ocean of material existence. Take hold of the hair on my head and rescue me from this ocean.

Providence is extremely powerful and does not consider one’s religiosity or knowledge; rather, it always binds one with the ropes of karma. I do not see even the slightest means of deliverance; all I see is misery. Thus I weep, helpless and stricken with grief.

Lust, anger, greed, and bewilderment, along with madness and pride, are dragging me to their respective abodes. My mind wanders like a blind man, without any understanding of the right or wrong path.

I have not accepted the tenets of religiosity; rather, my conscious­ness has been absorbed in irreligious matters. I have not aspired for your lotus feet. Narottama dāsa says, “O Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura, I fear what I see and hear around me. Grant me deliverance and keep me near you.”`
