    "en": `The lotus feet of śrī guru are the treasure house of unalloyed prema-bhakti. I worship those lotus feet with great care. By the mercy of śrī guru, O brother, one can cross over the material universe and attain Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Make the words emanating from the lotus mouth of śrī guru one with your heart and do not aspire for anything else. Attachment to the lotus feet of śrī guru is the greatest attainment. By his mercy, all desires are fulfilled.

He who gives the gift of transcendental vision is my master birth after birth. He manifests divine knowledge within one’s heart. From him prema-bhakti emanates, and by him ignorance is destroyed. The Vedic scriptures sing of his exalted character.

Śrī guru is an ocean of mercy, the friend of the fallen, and the life and soul of everyone. Alas, O Master! Please be merciful and give me the shade of your lotus feet. At your feet I have surrendered.`
