    "en": `One who worships Śrī Vrajendra-nandana makes his life successful. There is no equal to Him in the entire Vedas or in all the three worlds.

A person who fails to worship that Śrī Mādhava will die one day. Punished by Yamarāja, this abominable person will be eaten by worms and insects in the hell called Raurava.

There is no greater sinner within the universe, and he can never attain deliverance. Instead, he wanders about uselessly.

Śrī Locana dāsa describes the qualities of Śrī Hari with the desire to achieve bhakti and never sees the face of that person whose mind is not fixed on the essence all rasa, Śrī Vrajendra-nandana.`
