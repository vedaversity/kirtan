    "en": `All glories to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, who give pleasure to the cows, gopas, and gopīs.

All glories to Kṛṣna, who has a beautiful dark complexion, who enchants Cupid, and who is the moon of Vṛndāvana. All glories to He who revels with Rādhā, who relishes rāsa-līlā, and who is the joy of the land of Gokula.

All glories to Rādhā, who is the mistress of the rāsa-dance, the embodiment of Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure, and the moon of the dynasty of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja. All glories to all of the sakhīs, headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.

All glories to Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī, Rati Mañjarī, and Anaṅga Mañjarī. All glories to Paurṇamāsī Yogamāyā and all glories to Vīrā-devī’s [and Vṛndā-devī’s] group [of messengers of the Divine Couple].

All of you please bestow your compassion upon me, for I am extremely impoverished. Mercifully grant me the [service of the] lotus feet of the Divine Couple.`
