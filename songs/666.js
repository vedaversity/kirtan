    "en": `Worship Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā. He will ferry us across the ocean of material existence—Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā, the brother of Balarāma;  Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā, player of the flute; He who steals butter from the gopīs—just worship Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā.

Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā who lifted Govardhana Hill, Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā who performed rāsa-līlā—worship Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā, who will ferry us across the ocean of material existence.

When His friend Sudāma brought Him some poor quality rice, Kṛṣṇa threw His arms around Sudāma's neck and ate it. “Where have you been, brother?” He said, “Tell me, where have you been?” Just worship that Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā.

He became Arjuna’s war charioteer, that Śyāmaliyā (sweet, black, crooked Kṛṣṇa). At such a young age, He lifted Govardhana Hill and subdued Kālīya-nāga, dragging him from the Yamunā. Worship that Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā.

When wicked men surrounded the daughter of Drupada to disrobe her, He came to protect her chastity, lengthening her dress to infinity. Worship that Kṛṣṇa Kanhaiyā!`
