‘prema’ bali’ nāma,    ati adbhuta,
śruta haita kā’ra kāṇe

kevā jānāita āra ?
vṛndā-vipinera,    mahā madhurimā,
praveśa haita kā’ra

kevā jānāita,    rādhāra mādhurya,

tā’ra anubhava,    sāttvika vikāra,
gocara chila vā kā’ra

vraje ʝe-vilāsa,    rāsa-mahārāsa,
prema parakīẏa tattva
gopīra mahimā,    vyabhicārī sīmā,

    "en": `Except for the son of Mother Śacī…\t…who could have heard about that extraordinarily wonderful thing called prema?

…who could have announced the glorious qualities of the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa?\t…who could have entered into the supreme sweetness of the forests of Vṛndā-devī?

…who could have told us about the wondrous glories of the exceedingly sweet transcendental mellows that Śrī Rādhā experiences?\t…who could have understood what she experienced or Her ecstatic bodily transformations?

…who could have thoroughly understood the amorous pastimes of Vraja, the great rāsa-līlā, the fundamental truths of paramour love (parakīya-prema), the glories of the gopīs, and the limits of spiritual emotions?

By bestowing the greatest mercy, Śrī Nitāi and Śrī Caitanya have made this blessed age of Kali supremely glorious. They have filled the world with revelations of prema and its transformations, which are beyond the comprehension of even Lord Brahmā.

Without discriminating between the elevated and the fallen, They freely embraced everyone. Premānanda says, “Hold that Gaurāṅga within your heart!”`
