    "en": `Śrī Yamunā-devī prevents one from having to go to the city of her brother, Yamarāja (the lord of death). Simply seeing her delivers even the greatly wicked from an ocean of sins. Her sweet waters captivate everyone’s heart. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of the sun-god, Sūrya-deva [who, in this song, is called Aravinda-bandhu, friend of the lotus], always purify me.

She adorns Indra’s immense Khāṇḍava Forest with her enchanting current, and upon her blooming white lotuses, birds such as wagtails always dance. (What to speak of bathing,) simply desiring to bathe in her waters frees a sinner from his many heinous sins. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

Touching but a single drop of her water nullifies a person’s most heinous of crimes. She increases the current of rāgānuga-bhakti for Śrī Nanda-nandana and brings auspiciousness to anyone who simply desires to reside on her banks. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

She encircles the seven oceans, which are worshipped by the continents of the Earth. (In other words, she never merges into the seven oceans, as do ordinary rivers.) She is thoroughly acquainted with the divine play of Śrī Mukunda (and thus she makes those pastimes arise in the hearts of those who take shelter of her). The luster of her waters censures a host of blue sapphires. May Yamunā-devī daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

She is ornamented by the enchanting land of Mathurā-maṇḍala, and she is expertly nourishes the Vaiṣṇava path that is saturated with love, the sampradāya of rāgānuga-bhakti. (In other words, she manifests rāgānugā-bhakti in the heart of Vaiṣṇavas who bathe in her waters.) With the playful arms of her waves, she worships Padmanābha Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

Her charming banks are adorned by herds of loudly mooing cows and are perfumed by celestial fragrances emanating from the flowers of rows of kadamba trees. She is overjoyed by the gathering of Śrī Nanda-lāla’s bhaktas [on those banks]. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

She is filled with the sounds of hundreds of thousands of sweetly warbling mallikākṣa swans, whose wings are spread wide. She is worshiped by the devas, siddhas, kinnaras, and human beings whose hearts are dedicated to the service of Śrī Hari. The slightest touch of breezes from her banks eradicates the bondage of rebirth. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

Her currents fill the three worlds—Bhuḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and Svaḥ—with transcendental knowledge (cid-vilāsa). Just uttering her glories burns the greatest deeply rooted sins to ashes. She is supremely fragrant, due to unguents [such as sandal paste and kuṅkuma] coming from the body of Ballavendra-nandana Kṛṣṇa. May Yamunā-devī, daughter of Sūrya-deva, always purify me.

O Sūryaputri! O Devī! O Yamunā, whose powerful waves are purify­ing and who is surrounded by all the demigods! For those persons of satisfied intelligence who recite this prayer, please increase their current of bhakti for the lotus-eyed Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who liberates people from all their sins. This is my supplication at your feet.`
