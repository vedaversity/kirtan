śire cūḍā daraśa nirāle, 
vana phulamālā hiẏā para ḍole
pahirana pīta-paṭāmvara śobhe, 
nūpura ruṇujhunu caraṇana me̐

koī gāvata rādhā-kṛṣṇanāma, 
koī gāvata hai hariguṇa gāna
mṛdaṅga tāla-madhura rasāla, 
koī gāvata hai raṅga me̐`,

    "en": `That beautiful boy, the darling of Śacī, dances in śrī hari-kīrtana. The sandalwood tilaka on His forehead steals the mind, and resplendent curls rest on His cheeks.

His hair looks splendid in an extraordinary topknot, while a wildflower garland dances on His heart. The yellow sash He wears shines, and the bells around His ankles jingle.

Someone sings the names of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, another extols the glories of Hari, mṛdaṅga and karatālas converge in sweet medley, and others, still, delight as they sing.`
