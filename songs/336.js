    "en": `Chant the holy names of the munificent Nitāi and Caitanya and dance, my dear mind, dance. O mind, just dance!

(There is no one as merciful as Nitāi, for despite being beaten, He bestowed prema.) By chanting Their names, your offenses will go far away and you will obtain the treasure of prema. (There is no consideration of offenses in chanting Their holy names.) (Then) you will develop a taste for kṛṣṇa-nāma, and your bondage [to material existence] will be destroyed.

(You will develop deep attachment to kṛṣṇa-nāma.) (Then) auto­matically your life will become successful. (Without attachment to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, this life is simply useless.) (If you receive the mercy of Śrī Gaurāṅga,) (ultimately) you will receive the darśana of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Śyāmasundara in Vṛndāvana.`
