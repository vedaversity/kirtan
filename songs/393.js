    "en": `O Hari! Due to accumulating excessive wealth, endeavoring for sense enjoyment, engaging in frivolous gossip, being eager to accept rules and regulations unsuited to my own qualification, keeping bad association...

…and remaining absorbed in fickle conceptions, devotion to Śrī Hari remains far away. Within my heart, only envy of others, madness, arrogance, and wickedness arise.

Unable to relinquish all these tendencies, I am dying from my own vices! My birth has become fruitless. Now what shall I do, O Hari?

I am indeed fallen, but ‘Savior of the Fallen’ (patita-pāvana) is Your pristine name. Grasping that connection, I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.`
