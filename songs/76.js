    "en": `You inundate all of your associates in a flood of your splendor, which belittles gold, campaka flowers, and lightning. Your divine dress resembles the orange-red luster of the bandhūka flower. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

O Vṛndā! Your countenance is especially radiant, illuminated by the gentle smile rising on your bimba-red lips and the pearl on your nose. Your beauty is enhanced by various jeweled ornaments. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

The daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, Śrīmatī Rādhikā, has given you dominion over Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s most glorious Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma, which is the crown-jewel of all Vaikuṇṭha planets. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

By your order, the buds, blossoms, flowers, bees, deer, and all other kinds of animals and birds, as well as the six seasons headed by spring, brilliantly decorate the kuñjas where Śrī Mādhava enjoys His playful pastimes. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

Your adeptness at acting as a messenger makes it possible for the Youthful Couple of the kuñjas to accomplish Their playful, amorous pastimes, for which They are so eager. Who can properly describe your good fortune? O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

The desire to behold the rāsa-līlā, attain residence in Śrī Vṛndāvana, and perform service to the lotus feet of your Lord and Lady is attained by a person through your mercy alone. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

Those conversant in devotional scriptures (the bhakti-tantras) glorify you as Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s pastime potency (līlā-śakti). In this world, you assume the form of the tulasī tree. O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

Devoid of bhakti and guilty of unlimited offenses, we are flung into the waves of lust [anger, greed and so on]. O merciful one, we take shelter of you! O Vṛndā, we offer praṇāma to your lotus feet.

Those who, like bumblebees at the lotus feet of the Divine Couple, hear or recite this Vṛndā-devyāṣṭaka will obtain eternal residence in Vṛndāvana and become fulfilled, having attained loving service to Them.`
