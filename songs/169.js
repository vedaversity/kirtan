    "en": `All glories, all glories to the dear son of Jagannātha Miśra and Śacī-devī. His lotus feet are worshiped by the three worlds.

In Nīlācala He holds the conchshell, disc, club, and lotus flower, while in the town of Nadīyā He holds the staff of a renunciant and a water pot.

Some say that in a previous age He killed the demon Rāvaṇa. Then [as Lord Kṛṣṇa,] He revealed the glorious pastimes of Goloka.

Now, accepting the bhāva of Śrī Rādhā, He has come as the golden avatāra. Lord Gaura preaches the [chanting of the] Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

With folded hands, Vāsudeva Ghoṣa says, “He who is Gaura is also Kṛṣṇa, as well as Jagannātha.”`
