kise kūla pā’ba, tā’ra nā pāi sandhāna

nā āche karama-bala, nāhi jñāna-bala

nitānta durbala āmi, nā jāni sā̐tāra
e vipade ke āmāre karibe uddhāra

viṣaẏa-kumbhīra tāhe bhīṣaṇa-darśana
kāmera taraṅga sadā kare uttejana

prāktana vāẏura vega sahite nā pāri
kā̐diẏā asthira mana, nā dekhi kāṇḍārī

ogo śrī-jāhnavā devi! e dāse karuṇā
kara āji nijaguṇe, ghucāo ʝantraṇā

tomāra caraṇa-tarī kariẏā āśraẏa
bhavārṇava pāra ha’ba karechi niścaẏa

e dāse karaha dāna padakalpataru

kata kata pāmarere ka’recha uddhāra
tomāra caraṇe āja e kāṅgāla chāra`,

    "en": `Having fallen into this vast ocean of material existence, how will my bewildered soul find the shore? I have no clue how to reach it.

I have no strength of accumulated pious activities, knowledge, sacrifices, yogic practice, austerities, or religiosity. Indeed, I have no resources at all.

I am extremely weak and don’t know how to swim. Who will rescue me from this calamity?

The crocodile of sense enjoyment is a ferocious sight, and the waves of lust are constantly agitating me.

I cannot tolerate the raging winds of the consequences of my activities in prior births. I simply weep with an agitated mind, for I see no sailors [to rescue me].

O Śrī Jāhnavā-devī! By virtue of your own good qualities, show compassion to this servant today and remove my afflictions.

I have determined that I will cross over this vast ocean of material existence by taking shelter of the boat of your lotus feet.

You are the potency of Nityānanda Prabhu and the authority on kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Kindly bestow your lotus feet, which are like a desire-tree, upon this servant.

You have delivered many sinful persons. Today, this wretched beggar falls at your lotus feet.`
