    "en": `O Lord, I submit my humble entreaty at Your lotus feet. I do not pray for physical pleasures, knowledge, wealth, or followers.

I seek neither heaven nor salvation, nor do I pray for any kind of opulence.

Whatever birth I attain by the merits and faults of my karma, may I, birth after birth, sing the glories of Your holy name.

My only hope is that ahaitukī-bhakti (unmotivated devotion) for Your lotus feet awakens in my heart at every moment.

Whatever attraction I now have for worldly pleasures, may I develop such attraction for Your feet.

In adversity or prosperity, may that attraction remain steady. Day after day, may it grow by the influence of the holy name.

Be I a bird or a beast, in heaven or in hell, may bhakti to You remain perpetually within the heart of this Bhaktivinoda.`
