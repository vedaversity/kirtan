    "en": `In the waters of universal dissolution, You carried the Vedas, just like a boat, without any effort. O Keśava, who assumed the form of a fish [Matsya], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

The Earth rests on Your expansive back, hardened by the numerous callous formations resulting from that burden. O Keśava, who assumed the form of a tortoise [Kūrma], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

The Earth rests on the tip of Your tusk, set there like an infinitesimal spot on the face of the [waxing] moon. O Keśava, who assumed the form of a boar [Varāha], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

Upon the beautiful lotuses of Your hands, Your nails, with their amazing tips, have torn asunder the wasp-like body of Hiraṇyakaśipu. O Keśava, who assumed the form of a man-lion [Nṛsiṁha], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

You deceived Bali while taking [immense] strides, O wonderful Dwarf! You purify people by the [Ganges] water that emanates from Your toenails. O Keśava, who assumed the form of a dwarf [Vāmana], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

You liberate all the creatures of the world from sin, by letting them bathe in the waters [of the sacred land of Kurukṣetra], which is infused with the blood of unrighteous rulers. O Keśava, who assumed the form of the Lord of Bhṛghus [Paraśurāma], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

In the battle [of Laṅka] You distributed the heads of ten-headed Rāvaṇa, as the most desired and gratifying sacrificial offering, to the presiding demigods of the [ten] directions. O Keśava, who assumed the form of Rāma, all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

On Your brilliant white form, You wear garments the [dark blue] color of a rain cloud that resembles the hue of the Yamunā River, who came in Your presence, apprehensive of the striking of Your plow. O Keśava, who assumed the form of the wielder of the plough [Balarāma], all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

You decry the prescriptions of the Śrutis that pertain to sacrifice, Your heart brimming with compassion when You witness animal slaughter. O Keśava, who assumed the form of Buddha, all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

At the hour of death for the numerous barbarous hosts, You wield a sword that is as terrifying as a foreboding comet. O Keśava, who assumed the form of Kalki, all glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

Please hear this sincere prayer uttered by the poet Śrī Jayadeva. It awards happiness and auspiciousness and describes the essence of Your incarnations! O Keśava, who assumed ten forms! All glories to You, O Lord of the Universe, O Hari!

Unto the deliverer of the Vedas (Matsya), the upholder of all the worlds (Kurma), the savior of Mother Earth (Varāha), the slayer of [Hiraṇyakaśipu and other] demons (Nṛsiṁha), the deceiver of Bali (Vāmana), the destroyer of kṣatriyas (Paraśurāma), the conqueror of Rāvaṇa (Rāma), the wielder of the plow (Balarāma), the advocate of compassion (Buddha), and the vanquisher of the barbarians (Kalki); O You who assume these ten forms, O Kṛṣṇa, I offer my obeisances.`
