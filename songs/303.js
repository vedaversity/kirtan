    "en": `O Gopīnātha, I do not have any means of deliverance. Only if You grant Your causeless mercy and take me to Your realm shall I get deliverance from material existence.

O Gopīnātha, I have fallen into the perils of material illusion. Wealth, wife, and sons have completely surrounded me and kept me under the control of lust.

O Gopīnātha, my mind is completely mad. It does not accept any discipline and always remains ignorantly in the fearsome pit of sense gratification.

O Gopīnātha, I have accepted defeat. All my careful endeavors have proven futile. Now You are my only hope.

O Gopīnātha, how will my salvation be achieved? My powerful senses have brought my mind under their control and do not relinquish their addiction to worldly enjoyment.

O Gopīnātha, reside in my heart and restrain my mind, diverting it toward You. Thus, You will end my terrible predicament.

O Gopīnātha, You have seen that I am without shelter. You are the master of the senses, so subdue my senses and deliver me from this dark and perilous worldly existence.

O Gopīnātha, a noose is tightly fixed around my neck. Taking up the sword of Your mercy and severing this bondage, make this Bhaktivinoda Your servant.`
