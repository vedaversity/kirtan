    "en": `O Kṛṣṇa! O Deva! I am offering a prayer to You. Kindly place the bee of my mind within the honey of Your lotus feet.

Although Brahmā in full samādhi cannot catch a glimpse of even a ray of the effulgence emanating from the tips of Your toenails, still, O Acyuta, having heard of the waves of Your astonishing mercy, I long to receive Your grace.

O Mādhava, although I don’t possess even a sesame seed of bhakti for You, still, since You are the Supreme Controller, You can make the impossible possible.

O Sanātana, because Your lotus feet are filled with the most wonderful rasa, let the bee of my mind always reside unwaveringly in that nectar, which puts everything else to shame, for they are the essence of all sweetness.`
