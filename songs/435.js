    "en": `O mind, worship the lotus feet of Śrī Nanda-nandana, which bring fearlessness. This human birth is very rare, so take the association of saintly persons and cross over this ocean of material existence.

Suffering the pains of the cold, heat, wind, and rain, I remain sleepless day and night. I have uselessly served miserly and wicked men for a fraction of momentary happiness.

Wealth, youth, sons, and relatives—what assurance do they hold? This life is tottering like a drop of water on a lotus petal, so always serve and worship the feet of Śrī Hari.

Hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, serving His lotus feet, engaging as a servant, worshiping, serving Him as a friend, and completely offering Him one’s very self—these nine limbs of bhakti are Govinda dāsa’s cherished aspiration.`
