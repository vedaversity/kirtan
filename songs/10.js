    "en": `His two lotus feet are worshiped by an unlimited number of saintly persons, and he is the most competent personality to lead the process of realization for this age, nāma-saṅkīrtana. His adorable lotus feet grant all kinds of benedictions and fearlessness. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda.

He is the leader of the assembly of saints who are powerful in bhajana. He is most compassionate to the fallen, as he is their sole refuge. His inconceivable feet deceive the cheaters. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

His tall golden figure, which is very soft, mocks the pride of a golden lotus. His moonlike feet are worshiped by countless Cupids. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda. (3

He is the pleasing moon for his servitor stars, and with the excellence of a roaring lion he removes inimical persons [causing them to flee in fear]. Choosing the shelter of his feet, the innocent attain auspiciousness. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He has widely spread the splendor of Śrī Gaurāṅga’s holy abode, Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma; he has specially glorified Śrī Gaurāṅga’s mercy throughout the whole world; and he has bestowed Gaurāṅga’s holy feet upon those who are most desperate for mercy. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He is the eternal refuge and universal guru for the devotees of Śrī Gaurāṅga. He is always dedicated to the service of his holy master, Śrīla Gaura-kiśora dāsa Bābājī, and he is the abode of utmost honor for the feet of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He shares renown with Raghunātha dāsa, Rūpa, and Sanātana Gosvāmīs and is glorified the world over for emulating the philosophical genius of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. He shares friendship with Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī and Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Out of mercy, he reveals himself as the embodiment of hari-kīrtana. He is an eternal associate of Lord Gaura, born to remove the great burden of the Earth. His nature is even more loving and affectionate than that of a father. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He is a desire tree (of benedictions) for his surrendered servants. His patience and benevolence put a tree to shame. His divine feet are worshiped by the best of those who offer benedictions. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He is the best amongst paramahaṁsas. He holds the treasure of the ultimate objective of life (kṛṣṇa-prema). He accepts the dress of a sannyāsī to uplift the fallen souls. His feet are carefully served by the best among sannyāsīs. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

He is a most beloved attendant of the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu. I have taken shelter of his feet by keeping their dust [on my head]. Those feet possess immense and astonishing power to purify. I forever offer praṇāma unto the feet of Śrīla Prabhupāda.`
