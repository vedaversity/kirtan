    "en": `O Hari! Having forgotten You, my tongue is afflicted with the jaundice of ignorance. The ambrosia of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is unpleasant for me, as I am engrossed in worldly pleasures.

If, with loving regard, I daily chant that holy name, which acts like sugar candy that can destroy jaundice at its root, gradually that name will become sweet to me, O Hari!

My misfortune is that I have not developed loving regard for that name, O merciful Lord! How will the ten offenses [to the holy name], which are the cause of my misfortune, ever be obliterated?

If I sing Your holy name every day, by Your mercy, all my offenses will gradually disappear, a taste for Your holy name will develop within me, and I will relish the nectar of that name.`
