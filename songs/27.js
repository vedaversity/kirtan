    "en": `O Rādha! All glories to You, O Beloved of Mādhava! Your glories are sung by the circle of the youthful maidens of Gokula.

O You whose attire increases Dāmodara’s affection, O Queen of the Vṛndāvana Forest, You are the pleasure garden of Śrī Hari.

From the ocean of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, You arise like the new moon! O dearmost friend of Lalitā! O You who captivate the heart of Viśākhā with Your charming qualities!

Bestow Your compassion upon me, O You who brim with compassion! Your transcendental qualities and character are described by Sanaka and Sanātana.`
