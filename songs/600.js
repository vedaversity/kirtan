    "en": `All glories, all glories to the ārati ceremony of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda I am beholding. It bestows eternal service at the Yoga-pīṭha in Māyāpura [upon those who observe it].

The enchantingly sweet fragrance of the incense of his preaching spreads in all directions and attracts all liberated and conditioned beings, both moving and non-moving, like a swarm of honeybees.

He illuminated the entire universe with the lamp of the philosophical conclusions of pure devotional service. This lamp contains the flames of sevā in the five rasas.

Wherever those five great flames are, there are five great halos of light. They destroy the darkness of ignorance and depraved intelligence throughout the three worlds.

The current of water from the conch shell is the current of the teachings of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, which flows continuously and cannot be checked.

The bell, full of all musical sounds, resonates perpetually, but the music of the bṛhat-mṛdaṅga (the publication of holy scriptures) exhibits the highest sweetness.

Resplendent tilaka adorns his broad forehead, and a necklace of tulasī beads gleams around his neck.

With his long arms extending to his knees, his towering figure, and his complexion like molten gold, he is supremely beautiful.

His charming, lovely face displays a smile that is full of affection, and the beauty of his bodily complexion is like an eternally full moon.

Attired in cloth the color of the newly-risen sun, according to the religious principles of sannyāsa, he freed the Gauḓīya sky of the clouds of misconceptions [and established the doctrine of pure bhakti].

So many groves [his temples] are comprised of the flowers of bhakti [his devotees]. The entire universe is infatuated by their beauty and fragrance [their preaching].

Śrī Narahari Prabhu, the example of the perfection of service, waves the cāmara, while Keśava (Śrīla Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja) sings this ārati song with great delight.`
