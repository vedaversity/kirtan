    "en": `O Gurudeva! You have very mercifully given me a place in Godruma within the forests of Śrī Gauḓa-maṇḍala. You have ordered me to dwell in this place which is [non-different from] Vraja and to chant the holy names of Śrī Hari.

But when, O Master, will you mercifully bestow upon this servant the qualification [to fulfill your order]? At that time, my mind will be peaceful, I shall tolerate all that happens, and I shall earnestly perform bhajana of Śrī Hari.

Because I indulged in mundane pleasures during my childhood and youth, my habits have become unfavorable [to bhakti]. Due to the reactions of my own misdeeds, this body has become an impediment to performing bhajana.

Now, in old age, I have become afflicted with the diseases of the five senses. Please tell me how I can do bhajana [in this condition]. Weeping and weeping, I have fallen at your lotus feet, greatly overwhelmed.`
