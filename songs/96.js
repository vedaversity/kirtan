    "en": `O Gurudeva, give me a drop of mercy and make this servant more humble than a blade of grass. Give me the strength to tolerate everything and make me free from my vanity.

Give me the power, O Master, to honor all living entities according to their due. Then I shall chant the holy names of Śrī Hari blissfully, and my offenses will be vanquished.

When will this person receive such mercy and be successful in life, O Master? I am devoid of strength and intelligence and am extremely fallen. Kindly take my soul and make me your own.

If I consider my qualification, I find nothing of value; your mercy is the essence of my existence. If you are not merciful, then, weeping and weeping, I will no longer maintain my life.`
