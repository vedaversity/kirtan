    "en": `O Hari! My life passes uselessly. I have received this human birth, but by not performing bhajana of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, I have knowingly drunk poison.

Why has attachment for harināma-saṅkīrtana, Goloka-Vṛndāvana’s treasure of divine love, not awakened within me? Day and night my heart burns in the poisonous fire of material existence, and I have no means to alleviate it.

The son of the king of Vraja has become the son of Śacī-devī, and Balarāma has become Nitāi. Through harināma, They have delivered all those who were fallen and wretched. Jagāi and Mādhāi are testaments to this fact.

Narottama dāsa says, “O my Lord, son of Nanda Mahārāja! Accompanied by the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, be merciful to me at last. Do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet. Other than You, who is mine?”`
