    "en": `O Brilliant Goddess! O sovereign of all the demigods! O Bhagavati, dearly beloved of the Supreme Lord! O Gaṅgā, who brings liberation to the three worlds! Your waves are playful, and you reside on Lord Śaṅkara’s [Śiva's] crown! O Immaculate One! May my attention be fixed upon your lotus-like feet.

O Bhāgīrathī, who answered the prayers of King Bhagīratha! O Mother, who bestows bliss! The glory of your holy waters is described in the Vedas. I am entirely ignorant of your magnificence. O Merciful One, please save this dullard!

O Gaṅgā, who frolics at Śrī Hari’s lotus feet! Your waves are as white as snow, as white as the moon, and as white as pearls. Please eradicate the burden of my sins. Mercifully carry me across the ocean of material existence.

Anyone who drinks your pure water attains the highest destination. O Mother Gaṅgā, Yama, the god of death, cannot even look at that person who is devoted to you.

O savior of the fallen! O Gaṅgā, daughter of the sage Jahnu! Your streams are adorned by the best of mountains. O Mother of Bhīṣma! You are indeed the daughter of the best of sages.

You fulfill one’s desires just like a wish-fulfilling creeper. He who offers respect to you never perishes in grief. O Mother Gaṅgā, who frisks between two banks! The wives of the demigods restlessly glance at you from the corners of their eyes.

If by your mercy a person chances to bathe in your waters, he never takes birth from a mother’s womb again. O Gaṅgā, daughter of Sage Jahnu, you save one from hell and eliminate one's sinful reactions. You are always at the pinnacle of glory.

Your limbs are illustrious, and your waves are holy. Glory, glory to you, O Jāhnavi, whose whole body is comprised of compassion! Indra’s crown, studded with precious stones, always decorates your feet. O you who bestow happiness and goodness, you are the shelter of your servants.

O Bhagavati, please take away my disease, grief, suffering, sins, and delusion. Your presence is essential in the three worlds. You are the precious necklace embellishing the earth. You are doubtlessly my only shelter in the repeated cycle of birth and death.

O Alakānanda who descends from the Himālayas! O you who personify supreme bliss! Please bestow mercy upon me, for you are worshiped by all the wretched. Whoever lives on your banks indisputably resides in the transcendental abode of Vaikuṇṭha.

It is better to be a turtle or fish in your waters, a tiny lizard on your banks, or even a wretched dog-eater living within two krośas (four square miles) from you, than to be a king of noble lineage who lives far from you.

O Lady of the universe! O Blessed One! O Glorious One! O Goddess, whose form is liquid! O daughter of the best of sages! That person who always recites this impeccable prayer in praise of Gaṅgā-devī truly gains victory.

Bliss and liberation are the property of those whose heart is the abode of devotion to Gaṅgā. The amazing verses of this Gaṅgā-stotra, which are saturated with supreme bliss, are written by Śaṅkarācārya, the servant of Lord Śaṅkara, in the enchanting meter known as pajjhaṭikā.<br>This stotra bestows the desired result and liberates one from all types of burden. Thus ends this prayer, which is chanted regularly by gentle persons.`
