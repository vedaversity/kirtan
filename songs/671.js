lahara-lahara śrī śyāmā jiu kī, 
mana me mere samāī

raṭa-raṭa rādhā janama vitāū̐, 
raja-gopīna ku śīṣa navāū̐,
mahimā kahi nāhī̐ jāi

vraja tyaja ke mai̐ kahi nahi jāū̐, 
rasika santana ke darśana pāū̐,
jaga se prīti haṭāi`,

    "en": `Rādhā’s name confers supreme joy.

May [thoughts of] Śrī Śyāmā gather, wave after wave, in my mind.

Incessantly chanting ‘Rādhā’, I will live out my life. To the gopīs of Vraja, my head will remain bowed, for their glories are indescribable.

I will never leave Vraja to go elsewhere, and I will gain the darśana of rasika saints, thereby removing my affection for the world.`
