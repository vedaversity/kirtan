    "en": `O brothers! One day in Jagannātha Purī, at the time of honoring the Lord’s prasāda, Mahāprabhu Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya proclaimed, “O devotees, may you become blessed today by honoring the khicuḓi (rice and lentils cooked together) of the Lord in a pure state of mind.

“Lord Jagannātha has given you many varieties of extraordinary prasāda, such as khicuḓi  and piṭhā-pānā (coconut cake rolls in sweetened condensed milk). Take this prasāda until you are filled to the neck, and with your mouth chant, ‘Hari! Hari!’ Ignorance and sin will not be able to remain.

“The food remnants of Lord Jagannātha are worshipful for Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva. Upon eating these remnants, prema will arise in the heart. All of you have obtained such a rare treasure. All glories, all glories to Lord Jagannātha! All glories!”`
