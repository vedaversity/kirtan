    "en": `O Gopīnātha, please hear my prayer. I am a wicked materialist, always addicted to worldly desires, and I possess no good qualities.

O Gopīnātha, You are my only hope. I have taken shelter at Your lotus feet. I am Your servant.

O Gopīnātha, how will You purify me? I do not know what bhakti is, and my materialistic mind is absorbed in mundane fruitive activities. I have fallen into a dark and perilous worldly existence.

O Gopīnātha, everything here is Your māyā. I have no strength or spiritual knowledge, and this body is not free from the control of material nature.

O Gopīnātha, this wicked soul, weeping piteously, begs for an eternal place at Your lotus feet. Bestow Your mercy upon me.

O Gopīnātha, You are capable of everything. You have the power to deliver all wicked persons. Who else is there for this sinner?

O Gopīnātha, You are an ocean of mercy. Having come into this material world of five elements for the sake of the living entities, You display Your divine pastimes.

O Gopīnātha, how sinful I am! Even all the demons have attained Your lotus feet, but this Bhaktivinoda simply waits.`
