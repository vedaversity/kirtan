    "en": `I offer prayers to the lotus feet of Lord Viśvambhara, who removes the refuse from [the hearts of] the people of Kali-yuga.

He attracts His honeybee-like followers with His sweet fragrance, mercifully removing their anguish of separation from Him.

With His effulgence He destroys the darkness of māyā’s illusion, which has covered the hearts of the living entities since time immemorial.

He is forever resplendent with incomparable beauty. Rādhā-mohana dāsa feels an intense eagerness [to attain His shelter].`
