    "en": `O Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura, you are an ocean of mercy. Being compassionate upon this servant, purify me by giving me the shade of your feet, of which I take hold.

Help me to subdue the six urges and purify my six faults. Bestow upon this servant the six qualities of a devotee and give me the six kinds of devotional association. I am waiting in hope of attaining your association.

Alone I do not have the strength to perform harināma-saṅkīrtana. Being kind and giving me one drop of faith, bestow upon me the priceless treasure of kṛṣṇa-nāma.

Kṛṣṇa is yours, so you have the power to give Kṛṣṇa. I am only a beggar running behind you, calling out “Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!”.`
