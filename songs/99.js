    "en": `All glories, all glories to śrī guru, the desire-tree of prema, whose manifestation is most astonishing. With effulgent moonbeams of knowledge, he destroys the vast darkness of ignorance in the heart.

His eyes are the abode of bliss. Seeing a person as fallen as me, this personality voluntarily gave me harināma, even without my asking.

I am wicked and helpless, and my mind is constantly absorbed in mundane matters; I do not possess even one iota of devotional merit. Yet he still instructs me about Śrī Vṛndāvana and the treasure of bhajana of the Divine Couple.

Showering the world with the pure nectar of gaura-prema, śrī guru fulfills everyone’s hopes. Having not developed rati for his lotus feet, this Vaiṣṇava dāsa weeps.`
