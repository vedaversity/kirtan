    "en": `O Hari! Mud and foam may be observed in the waters of Jāhnavī (the Ganges), who possesses an aqueous nature, but the nature of liquefied transcendence never leaves those waters.

Similarly, the body of the Vaiṣṇava is always transcendental. From any perspective, his nature and body are never mundane. As such, one who criticizes him falls into consummate heresy.

For that offense, the soul perpetually receives suffering from Yamarāja. O Nanda-nandana, may I not be destroyed by such an offense.

Your Vaiṣṇavas are Your glory. May they be merciful to me. Then my journey will lead to You, and I will attain the shade of Your lotus feet.`
