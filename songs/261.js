    "en": `To serve the lotus feet of the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu, I shall become Her pālya-dāsī (affectionately sheltered maidservant) and strive to constantly bring Her all happiness.

I shall know within my heart that Śrī Kṛṣṇa takes pleasure in Śrī Rādhā’s happiness, and so I shall never desire to abandon Her lotus feet and to enjoy separately with Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

The sakhīs are my supreme well-wishers and my gurus regarding the loving affairs of the Divine Couple. Remaining faithfully under their guidance, I shall serve Śrī Rādhā’s lotus feet, which are like wish-fulfilling trees.

Let anyone aside from Śrī Rādhā’s party be as they are. I am indeed always partial to Śrīmatī Rādhikā and never look upon those who are not.`
