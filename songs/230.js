hena prabhu kothā’ gelā ācārya ṭhākura

kā̐hā mora svarūpa-rūpa, kā̐hā sanātana
kā̐hā dāsa-raghunātha, patita-pāvana

kā̐hā mora bhaṭṭayuga, kā̐hā kavirāja
ekakāle kothā’ gelā gorā naṭarāja

pāṣāṇe kuṭiba māthā, anale paśiba
gaurāṅga guṇera nidhi kothā’ gele pāba

se-saba saṅgīra saṅge ʝe kaila vilāsa
se-saṅga nā pāi͌yā kānde narottamadāsa`,

    "en": `He who brought the treasure of prema, out of his great compassion––where has such a venerable personality as Śrī Śrīnivāsa Ācārya gone?

Where are my Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī? Where is Sanātana Gosvāmī? Where is Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, the savior of fallen souls?

Where are my Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī? Where is Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī? Where has Gaurāṅga, the king of dancers, suddenly gone?

I shall dash my head upon a stone or enter into fire! Oh, where should I go to find Gaurāṅga, the treasure-house of all divine qualities?

Unable to obtain the association of that Śrī Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, who performed pastimes with the associates of Mahāprabhu, Narottama dāsa weeps.`
