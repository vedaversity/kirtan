    "en": `The great sage Nārada plays his vīṇā in accompaniment to [the chanting of] the names of Śrī Rādhikā-Ramaṇa, and the holy name immediately appears amidst the devotees’ singing.

When the current of nectar [of the holy names of the Lord] streams profusely and enters both ears, the devotees dance continuously, their heart filling with joy.

The stream of sweet nectar maddens the people of the universe. Some weep, some dance, and others become fully intoxicated within their minds.

The five-headed Lord Śiva, embracing Nārada, roars repeatedly out of prema, while he who sits upon a lotus flower, Lord Brahmā, dances enthusiastically and calls out, “Haribol! Haribol!”

Thousand-headed Lord Śeṣa, feeling supreme happiness, sings, “Hari!  Hari!”  By the influence of the holy name, the entire universe becomes maddened, and everyone tastes the rasa of the holy name.

This servant, Bhaktivinoda, prays at the lotus feet of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, “May the holy names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa fulfill all my desires by manifesting upon my tongue.”`
