    "en": `I worship the lotus feet of that form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa who, by being absorbed in anxious thought of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, has assumed Her golden feature.<br><br><small>[Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s immersion in separation from Śrīmatī Rādhikā, who is in māna (jealous anger), intensifies to such a point that He assumes Her golden complexion. Alternately, rādhāliṅgita means He finally embraces Śrīmatī Rādhikā after Her māna is broken.]</small>

When the supreme object of loving service and the supreme loving servant merge in absolute love, how can any distinction be made between Them? But when They are separated, all of Their distinctions are continuously amplified. <br><br><small>[Śrī Kṛṣṇa is sevyā, the supreme object of service, and bhoktā, the supreme transcendental enjoyer; and Śrīmatī Rādhikā is sevaka, the supreme servant, and bhogya, the supreme transcendental object of His enjoyment. In sambhoga, transcendental union, They are abheda, non-different. However, in vipralambha, transcendental separation, Their bheda, or duality, in the form of unique qualities, is amplified more and more.]</small>

The Divine Couple, who eternally engage in transcendental pastimes, comprise an existential reality that is inconceivably differentiated and non-differentiated, for the supreme potency and the supreme possessor of potency are always one with each other. <br><br><small>[Para-tattva, the supreme existential reality, is never without His energy, śakti. When śakti (potency) and śaktimān (the supreme source of all potency) have a single form, then gaura-tattva, the reality of Śrī Gaura-candra, is manifest. And when They are in two separate bodies, līlā-puruṣottama Śrī Kṛṣṇa enjoys unlimited transcendental pastimes with Śrīmatī Rādhikā.]</small>

One should know that the Absolute Truth, which is one without a second, has divided His pastimes into two parts. Gaura is Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is Gaura; hence both of Them are factually the original form of Godhead.<br><br><small>[Although the Supreme Absolute Truth is one, He has two sets of pastimes. In one, He is Śyāmasundara Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and in the other He is Śrī Gaurasundara. Śyāmasundara is Gaurasundara, and Gaurasundara is Śyāmasundara. Thus both of them are in fact Svayam Bhagavān, the Original Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom all other forms of God are manifest.]</small>

Wherever all colors exist simultaneously, a golden hue is manifest. However, in the absence of all color, a black hue is manifest.<br><br><small>[According to natural science, when the entire visible light spectrum is present in naturally occurring proportions, as in the sun, a golden hue is manifest. In Sanskrit, this is called gaura-kānti. On the other hand, when all visible light is absent, a black hue is manifest. This is called śyāma-kānti.]</small>

The Supreme Absolute Truth, which is one without a second, is both replete with qualities and devoid of qualities. All transcendental qualities are eternally manifest in Śrī Gaura. And the totality of transcendental humors, completely devoid of any mundane qualities, is manifest in Śrī Kṛṣṇa.<br><br><small>[The word varṇa (complexion) in the previous verse and the word guṇa (quality) in this verse establishes śrī-gaura-tattva to be as worshipful as śrī-kṛṣṇa-tattva. The Supreme Absolute Truth is both saguṇa, or possessed of all transcendental qualities, and nirguṇa, or devoid of all material qualities.]</small>

Those who give up this twofold form of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Absolute, and worship the undifferentiated, all-pervading imper­sonal existence are intelligently looking for rice in empty husks.<br><br><small>[Although someone may be learned in all scriptures, his endeavors to obtain mukti (impersonal liberation) by worshiping the impersonal brahma will only amount to fruitless labor. In other words, such a person is not intelligent at all.]</small>

By the mercy of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda, I worship Śrī Vinoda-bihārī and Śrīmatī Rādhikā as They meet with one another.<br><br><small>[By the mercy of śrī guru, I am granted darśana (a transcendental vision) of the Divine Couple, Śrī Śrī Rādha-Vinoda-bihārī, at the time of Their transcendental meeting.]</small>

Whoever recites this aṣṭakam every day, with great faith, will fully comprehend kṛṣṇa-tattva and become immersed in meditation on the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurasundara.`
