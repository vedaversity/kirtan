    "en": `When the reddish sun began to rise on the eastern horizon, Śrī Gaurāṅga, the jewel among the twice-born, at once awoke. Taking His devotees with Him, He went into the towns and villages of Navadvīpa.

“Tāthai, tāthai,” the mṛdaṅgas resounded, and the karatālas played in time. Overflowing with prema, Śrī Gaurāṅga’s golden limbs swayed gracefully, causing the ankle bells (nūpura) on His feet to jingle.

“Mukunda! Mādhava! Yādava! Hari! Everyone, chant! Everyone chant, filling your mouths with the holy names of the Lord! Oh, you pass your nights in vain, captivated by sleep, and your days in decorating your body.

“Don’t any of you think about what you are doing, having achieved this rare human body? If you do not worship the son of Yaśodā now, you will fall into a shameful condition at the time of death.

“With every rising and setting of the sun, you are busy counting the passing days. Why, then, do you still remain idle and not worship the Lord of the heart?

“Know this essential fact: material life is temporary and filled with various troubles and burdens. Earnestly take shelter of the holy name and remain engaged in your occupational duties.”

Drink the pure nectar of kṛṣṇa-nāma and thus give relief to Bhaktivinoda’s burning heart. There is nothing except the holy name within all the fourteen worlds.

Desiring to benefit the living entities, these sweet holy names have come to the material world. They shine like the sun in the sky of the heart, destroying the darkness of ignorance.`
