    "en": `When, as I cry “Gaurāṅga!” will I relinquish eating, sleeping, and other such bodily endeavors, being completely detached from them?

At that time, having abandoned my false ego, I shall wander from town to town in Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma, performing mādhukarī at the homes of the dhāma-vāsīs, and thus eat to the full satisfaction of my belly.

Going to the bank of Gaṅgā, I shall drink, palmful by palmful, the sacred water that has washed the lotus feet of the Lord. Lying under the shade of a tree, I shall relieve my fatigue and restore strength to my body.

Loudly calling out, “Gaura-Gadādhara!” “Śrī Radhā-Mādhava!” in entreaty, and bitterly weeping, I shall wander throughout the entire dhāma.

Seeing a Vaiṣṇava, I shall fall at his lotus feet, knowing him to be the true friend of my heart. Accepting me as his servant, that venerable Vaiṣṇava will cause me to behold the kīrtana performances of Mahāprabhu.`
