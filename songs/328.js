juḍ̌āiba tāpita-parāṇa
sājāiẏā diba hiẏā,    basāiba prāṇapriẏā,
nirakhiba se candrabaẏāna

he sajani! kabe mora haibe sudina
se prāṇanāthera saṅge,    kabe vā phiriba raṅge,
sukhamaẏa ʝamunāpulina

sājāiẏā nānā upahāra
sadaẏa haiẏā vidhi,    milāibe guṇanidhi,
hena bhāgya haibe āmāra?

dāruṇa vidhira nāṭa,    bhāṅgila premera hāṭa,

kahe narottamadāsa,    ki mora jīvane āśa,
chāḍ̌i’ gela vrajendrakumāra`,

    "en": `Oh, when will I attain the treasure of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and place Him in the core of my heart, thus relieving my burning soul? I will decorate my heart, place my beloved there, and then gaze upon His beautiful moon-like face.

O my dear friend, when will that auspicious day be mine? When will I blissfully wander with the Lord of my heart along the banks of the Yamunā River?

Accompanied by Lalitā and Viśākhā, I will go and meet with Him, adorning Him with gifts. Being compassionate, Providence will unite me with that reservoir of all good qualities—such a destiny will be mine.

Alas, the dance of cruel Providence has shattered the marketplace of prema, and not even a sesame seed is left. Narottama dāsa laments, “What hope remains in my life now that the son of the king of Vraja has left me?”`
