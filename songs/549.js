taṅ vrajaprema,    mahānidhi kuṭharīka,
kon kapāṭa ughāḍ̌ata

nīra-kṣīra-haṁsana,    pāna-vidhāẏana,
kon pṛthak kari pāẏata
ko saba tyaji’,    bhaji’ vṛndāvana,
ko saba grantha viracita

ʝav pitu vanaphula,    phalata nānāvidha,
manorāji aravinda
so madhukara vinu,    pāna kon jānata,
vidyamāna kari bandha

ko jānata,    mathurā vṛndāvana,
ko jānata vrajanīta
ko jānata,    rādhāmādhava-rati,
ko jānata soi prīta

ʝākara-caraṇa-,    prasāde sakala jana,
gāi gāoẏāi sukha pāota
caraṇa-kamale,    śaraṇāgata mādho,
tava mahimā ura lāgata`,

    "en": `Had Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī not appeared in this age of Kali, who would have opened the doors to the great treasure-house of vraja-prema?

Who but Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī could have extracted the essence of the scriptures in the same way that a swan separates water from milk? Who could have abandoned everything to perform bhajana in Vṛndāvana? Who could have written such scriptures?

He was a honey bee amid varieties of blossoming yellow forest flowers and mind-enchanting lotuses. Without that honey bee, who could have known the art of drinking the nectar present yet confined within [those flowers]?

Who could have understood the glories of Mathurā and Vrṇdāvana? Who could have fathomed the intricacies of Vraja? Who could have understood the rati between Śrī Rādhā and Mādhava? Who could have known that love?

By the mercy of his lotus feet, all souls may sing and inspire others to sing [about glories of the love of Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava], thereby attaining true joy. [O Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī,] having surrendered at your lotus feet, may this Mādhava dāsa be able to comprehend your unlimited glories.`
