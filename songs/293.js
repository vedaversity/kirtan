    "en": `If you have the desire to have fun and laugh with friends, then heed my words: don’t go, do not go near Keśī-ghāṭa in Mathurā.

There, Śrī Hari has taken the form of Govinda, whose eyes are graced with a crooked glance and whose mouth is graced with a gentle smile. How captivating is His threefold bending pose, replete with a radiant blackish complexion and limbs as lovely as tender new leaves.

The flute on His lips is the cause of great peril. O brother, have no faith in that crest of peacock feathers. Upon beholding that form with the eyes, no one ever returns home. The family life of a householder [who does so] becomes completely destroyed. (This is the great fear of my mind!)

(This is the great fear of my mind!) A grave calamity will occur, O householder, so do not go near Keśī-ghāṭa in Mathurā.`
