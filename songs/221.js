    "en": `The holy names of Nitāi and Gaura are the abode of bliss. Yama Mahārāja captures those who never utter these names and plunges them into the hellish planets.

The contemptible person who does not wear a necklace of tulasī beads has residence in the abode of Yama, and the person who never wears tilaka has a life that goes in vain.

Fate is apathetic toward one who never chants harināma. Such a person is most base and has an atheistic mentality. What will be the destiny of one who does not perform service to the Vaiṣṇavas?

The dīkṣā-mantras given by śrī guru are the essence of every­thing. Chant them now, in this life, and you will attain residence in Vraja. The mode of ignorance will leave you, the mode of goodness will enter you, and you will become a servant of Kṛṣṇa.

This Locana dāsa always tells everyone to sing the glories of Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi in great happiness. Those who have no attachment for this nectar have lime-paste and soot smeared on their faces [in disgrace].`
