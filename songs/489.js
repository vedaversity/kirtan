    "en": `Dust from the lotus feet of the pure devotees is most favorable for bhajana. Service to the pure devotees is the highest perfection and the very root of the creeper of prema.

I carefully observe Mādhava’s holy days [such as Ekādaśī and Janmāṣṭamī], for they are the mother of devotion. Knowing that Kṛṣṇa dwells in these holy days, with great regard I, also, accept them as my residence.

In the company of devotees who have transcendental love, I will behold all the places where my Gaura joyfully wandered.

My heart always prays for the opportunity to hear the mṛdaṅga play. Upon hearing a kīrtana glorifying Śrī Gaura, my heart dances in joy.

Upon seeing the deity forms of the Divine Couple, I feel the highest bliss. Honoring Their prasāda enables one to conquer the material world of five elements.

My home is transformed into Goloka Vṛndāvana when I see bhajana of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa being performed there. When I look upon the Gaṅgā, which is the nectar [emanating] from the Lord’s feet, my happiness knows no bounds.

Upon seeing tulasī, my heart becomes satisfied, because I know that she pleases Mādhava. When I honor śāk (a variety of greens), which is very dear to Gaura, I consider my life successful.

Whatever he finds favorable for kṛṣṇa-bhajana, Bhaktivinoda accepts every day with the greatest happiness.`
