ʝe chāẏāẏa jagat juḍ̌āẏa
hena nitāi vine bhāi,    rādhākṛṣṇa pāite nāi,

se-sambandha nāhi ʝā’ra,    vṛthā janma gela tā’ra,
sei paśu vaḍ̌a durācāra
nitāi nā balila mukhe,    majila saṁsāra-sukhe,
vidyākule ki karibe tā’ra

ahaṅkāre matta haiy͌ā,    nitāi-pada pāsariẏā,
asatyare satya kari’ māni
nitāiẏera karuṇā ha’be,    vraje rādhākṛṣṇa pā’be,
dhara nitāiẏera caraṇa du’khāni

nitāiẏera caraṇa satya,    tā̐hāra sevaka nitya,
nitāi-pada sadā kara āśa
narottama vaḍ̌a duḥkhī,    nitāi more kara sukhī,
rākha rāṅgā caraṇera pāśa`,

    "en": `The lotus feet of Nitāi are as cooling as millions of moons. Their shade gives solace to the entire universe. Without a personality such as Nitāi, O brother, it is not possible to attain Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, so firmly take hold of His lotus feet.

If someone does not establish a relationship with Nityānanda Prabhu, his human birth is wasted. Such an animalistic person is very wicked. Not uttering the name of Nitāi with his lips, he drowns himself in the [so-called] happiness of the material world. What, then, can his education and pedigree do for him?

Maddened by false pride and forgetting Nitāi’s lotus feet, one considers illusion to be truth. If Nitāi is merciful, one can attain Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in Vraja, so firmly take hold of Nitāi’s two lotus feet.

The lotus feet of Nitāi are eternal truth, and His servitors are eternally liberated. Always aspire to attain the lotus feet of Nitāi. Narottama is very unhappy. O Nitāi, please make me happy by keeping me close to the reddish soles of Your lotus feet.`
