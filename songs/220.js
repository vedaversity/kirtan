prāṇa mora ʝugalakiśora
advaita-ācārya bala,    gadādhara mora kula,
narahari vilasai mora

vaiṣṇavera padadhūli,    tāhe mora snānakeli,
tarpaṇa mora vaiṣṇavera nāma
vicāra kariẏā mane,    bhaktirasa āsvādane,
madhyastha śrībhāgavata-purāṇa

vaiṣṇavera ucchiṣṭa,    tāhe mora manoniṣṭha,
vaiṣṇavera nāmete ullāsa
vṛndāvane cautārā,    tāhe mora manogherā,
kahe dīna narottamadāsa`,

    "en": `Nityānanda Prabhu is my wealth, Śrī Gaura-candra is my master, and the youthful Divine Couple of Vraja are my very life. Advaita Ācārya is my strength, Gadādhara Paṇḍita is my family, and Narahari Sarakāra is my joy.

My bath is in the dust of the lotus feet of Vaiṣṇavas, my satiation is in the names of the Vaiṣṇavas, and I have concluded that in order to savor bhakti-rasa, the best medium is Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

My mind has firm faith in the remnants of the Vaiṣṇavas and delights in the names of the Vaiṣṇavas. My mind is fully encircled by the boundary of Vṛndāvana. Thus speaks the lowly Narottama dāsa.`
