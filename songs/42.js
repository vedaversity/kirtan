    "en": `Vanamali Krishna is adorned with a garland of forest flowers and his form is scintillating. He is dressed in the most fascinating attire, exactly like the god of sensuality. Dont make him wait, Radhe. Follow the Lord of your heart.

He is currently waiting in a forest bower on the gentle Malaya-windswept shore of the Yamuna.   He waits for you Radhe

O Radha, he is softly playing his flute, as if calling your name. He considers himself immensely fortunate to be touched by the pollen, that have first touched your body. As they come to him on the breeze, he receives them with the utmost honour.

As Krishna joyfully makes the bed, he experiences many internal visions. When a bird landing on a tree rustles the leaves and makes the slightest sound, Krishna glances with startled eyes along the path of your expected arrival.

Sakhi, go! Move in the direction of that thicket. Take off your ankle-bells. They clang like traitors in your play. Put on this dark blue garment.

Your garland falls on Murari’s chest , which is decorated with a necklace of jewels,  like lightening on a dark cloud.Drink that intoxicated love & enjoy your sukruta (good fortune).

O blue lotus-eyed Radha, loosen your vasanas & drink the bhakti rasa. Be with your lover’s joyful fulfillment, on a bed of freshly sprouted leaves.

Now Sri Hari is full of pride. The last period of the night is about to pass, so accept my advice. Go at once, without further delay, and fulfil the desires of Lord Sri Krishna (Madhu

O saints! Krishna is exuberant, causelessly merciful, exceptionally sweet, virtuous and adorned with all desirable qualities. Offer obeisances to him with a joyful heart by reciting this song of Sri Jayadeva, the composer of the most enchanting poetry and the servant of Sri Hari.`
