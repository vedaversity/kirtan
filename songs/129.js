    "en": `I have heard from the lips of the sādhus—all of them contend—that by Śrī Rūpa’s mercy one can attain the lotus feet of the Divine Couple.

O Sanātana Prabhu! O personal associates of Gaurāṅga! Together, all of you please fulfill my desires.

May the mercy of Śrī Rūpa fall upon me. Whoever takes shelter of Śrī Rūpa’s lotus feet is a great personality.

When will my master, Śrī Lokanātha Gosvāmī, take me with him and offer me at Śrī Rūpa's lotus feet?

Will such a destiny ever be mine that, through their instructions, the narma-sakhīs make Narottama their faithful follower?`
