    "en": `Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s bodily complexion snatches away the pride of a golden lotus flower tinged with kuṅkuma. Her bodily fragrance reproaches the fame of the scent of a lotus combined with saffron. She fulfills all the desires of the cowherd prince of Vraja. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

Her multi-colored silk sārī decries the splendor of coral. She is a garden of blooming flowers for the playful pleasure of the maddened bee Śrī Kṛṣṇa. She worships the sun-god to obtain the perpetual association of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

The sublime softness of Her body reprimands the fame of a cluster of delicate blossoms. Her body’s coolness is worshipful for the moon, sandalwood paste, the lotus, and camphor. Her touch dispels the heat of Gopī-jana-vallabha Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s amorous desires. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

Though honored by all the revered goddesses of the universe, Lakṣmī-devī does not compare with Śrīmatī Rādhikā in the opulence of Her beauty, eternal youth, and so on, nor does she surpass Her by

She is expert in the beautiful arts of rāsa-līlā, such as dancing, singing, and joking. She is adorned with supernatural prema, enchanting beauty, wonderful attire, and all divine virtues. Among all youthful cowherd maidens, She is topmost. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

By Her opulences of ever-fresh beauty, playfulness, and feelings for Kṛṣṇa, She causes all the young cowherd maidens, who are bound in deep attachment (anurāga) for Śrī Kṛṣṇa, to tremble. She is immersed in perpetual trance upon Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, attire, and playful pastimes. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

She is decorated with sattvika-bhāvas such as perspiration, trembling, horripilation, tears, and a choked voice. She is adorned by ornaments of bhāvas, such as indignation, joy and contrariness, and She is bedecked with an array of jeweled ornaments, by which She delights the eyes of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

Upon being separated from Śrī Kṛṣṇa for even half a moment, She becomes distressed by the ever-arising feelings of lowliness and great restlessness; and She is relieved of all Her mental anguish upon meeting Kṛṣṇa as a result of the intense efforts of one of Their messengers. May that Śrīmatī Rādhikā forever bless me with service to Her lotus feet.

Śrīmatī Rādhikā, whose darśana is rarely attained even by Pārvatī-devī and other goddesses, gives great pleasure to Her sakhīs. She Herself becomes elated upon meeting with Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and She is Kṛṣṇa’s dearest beloved. She quickly makes that person who prays to Her by singing this aṣṭaka a recipient for the nectar of service to Her.`
