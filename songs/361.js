    "en": `“Everyone, chant, chant, chant the holy names of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa!” Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu are dancing throughout Navadvīpa, giving this instruction to all. “O brothers, you are caught up in the whirlpool of illusory māyā, and are desperately struggling to remain afloat.

“If you just develop the faith that the jīva is a servant of Kṛṣṇa, you will have no more sorrows. As soon as you utter the name of Kṛṣṇa, your body will shiver in ecstasy and tears will flow from your eyes.”

Bhaktivinoda says, “O brothers, simply chant the holy names of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in the association of Vaiṣṇavas. This is all I beg of you. When you chant Their names, all your troubles will go away.”`
