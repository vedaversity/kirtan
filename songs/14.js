    "en": `Perpetually immersed in singing, dancing, and heartfelt kīrtana [of the name, form, qualities, pastimes, associates, and realm] of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the six Gosvāmīs embody the ocean of nectarean love. Dear to both gentlemen and ruffians, always engaged in pleasing activities, and completely free from envy, they are adored by all. They are the recipients of Śrī Caitanya’s immense mercy, and they therefore remove the burden of the earth (through the distribution of bhakti-rasa). I worship [the six Gosvāmīs:] Śrī Rūpa, Śrī Sanātana, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Śrī Raghunātha dāsa, Śrī Jīva, and Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa.

They are uniquely expert in ascertaining the essence of all revealed scriptures, and they establish the supreme occupation of the soul (bhagavad-bhakti). They are the true benefactors of the people, worshipful for the three worlds, and affectionate to those who have taken shelter of them. Due to the bliss of bhajana of the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, they have become like intoxicated honeybees. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

They are enriched with deep faith in the process of describing the various qualities of Śrī Gaurāṅga. They nullify the great distress generated from the sinful activities of embodied beings by showering on them nectarean songs about Govinda. They are especially expert in expanding the ocean of bliss, and they rescue all from impersonalism (by imparting the secrets of bhakti). I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

They fully abandoned at once the association of kingly aristocracy, deeming it insignificant, and out of compassion they humbly wore only loincloths and ragged quilts. Thereafter, they repeatedly immersed themselves in the delightful, billowing waves in the nectarean ocean of rasa—the bhāvas felt by the gopīs. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

Crowded with sweetly cooing cuckoos, swans, and cranes, as well as groups of peacocks, Vṛndāvana is shining beautifully with trees that have many varieties of gems inlaid beneath their roots. There, day and night, the Gosvāmīs intensely worship Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, thus endowing all jīvas with the ultimate benefit of life. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

They would pass their time by daily chanting a fixed number of holy names, singing particular songs, and offering regulated obeisances [to saints, deities, and the Lord’s pastime places]. Thus they fully conquered the urges of eating, sleeping, recreation, and so forth. Always considering themselves to be unlimitedly lowly and insignificant, they became enchanted in sweet rapture by remembering Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s qualities. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

Wandering along the banks of Rādhā-kuṇḍa or the Yamunā, and sometimes at Vaṁśīvaṭa, they would be forever seized by limitless transcendental states, intoxicated by the utter madness of prema. Overwhelmed with bhāva, they would jubilantly sing about the exalted qualities of Śrī Hari. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.

“O Rādha, Queen of Vṛndāvana! O Lalitā! O son of Nanda Mahārāja! Where are You? Are You beneath the kalpa-vṛkṣa trees of Śrī Govardhana Hill? Or are you in the forests on the banks of the Kālindī?” Thus calling out, greatly overwhelmed in separation, they would wander throughout the length and breadth of Vraja-maṇḍala. I worship Śrī Rūpa, Sanātana, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa, Raghunātha dāsa, Jīva, and Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmīs.`
