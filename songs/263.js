    "en": `Decorate your body with the dust of Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s lotus feet, and you will easily attain Giridhārī. One who takes shelter of Rādhikā’s lotus feet is a great personality, and I heartily glorify such a soul.

All glories to the name of Rādhā, whose abode is Śrī Vṛndāvana. She is the repository of loving pastimes that bring happiness to Śrī Kṛṣṇa. If my ears do not hear such narrations of Rādhā’s glories, then destiny has cheated me.

One who always engages in love-filled discussions of Her rasa-laden pastimes with Her devotees attains Ghanaśyāma . One who is averse to this will never attain perfection. Let me not even hear the name of such a person.

O brother, by chanting Kṛṣṇa’s name, one attains the lotus feet of Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and by chanting Rādhā’s name, one attains Śrī Kṛṣṇa-candra. I have briefly spoken advice by which you may dispel the sufferings of your heart. Contradictory words will only lead to pain and sorrow.`
