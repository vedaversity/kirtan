    "en": `Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the beloved of Rādhā and the delight of Rādhā. He is controlled by Rādhā, and He is the merriment of Rādhā.

He revels with Rādhā, He is the Lord of Rādhā, and He basks in the radiance of Rādhā. He is the relisher of Rādhā, the lover of Rādhā, and He thrills in uniting with Rādhā.`
