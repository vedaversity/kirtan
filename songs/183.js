    "en": `Who will go? Who will go, O brothers, across this ocean of material existence? This age of Kali is blessed, due to the descent of Śrī Caitanya!

A free ferryboat operates at the port of my Gaurāṅga. Even the old, the blind, and the crippled are crossing over.

Harināma is the boat, śrī guru is the helmsman, and the upraised arms of the saṅkīrtana party are the oars.

All jīvas are crossing over by the favorable winds of prema. Only Locana dāsa, due to his own fault, has been left behind.`
