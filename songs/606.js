    "en": `All glories, all glories to the meeting of the Divine Couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. The sakhīs, led by Lalitā-devī, perform Their ārati ceremony.

The beautiful threefold bending form of Kṛṣṇa, the enchanter of Cupid, wears yellow silk garments and a crown of peacock feathers, captivating the minds of all.

To the left of the charming Mādhava is the beautiful daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu, Śrīmatī Rādhikā. She wears blue garments, Her complexion is the color of molten gold, and She is well endowed with beauty and other fine qualities.

She is adorned with various ornaments that sparkle and shimmer. Her radiant face enchants the mind of Śrī Hari.

The sakhīs, led by Viśākhā-devī, sing in various melodies, while other priya-narma-sakhīs fan the Divine Couple with cāmaras.

Hoping to attain the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava, Bhaktivinoda happily floats in happiness at the lotus feet of the sakhīs.`
