    "en": `O my dear friend, Kṛṣṇa, good fortune will be Yours – Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī will be pleased with You – when You perform this supremely virtuous act [which I will now convey]. This I declare to You with utter conviction.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura is extremely dear to the son of Mother Śacī, Śrī Gaurasundara, and his service to Śrī Krsna is unequalled. He is that most exalted guru, the most excellent and magnanimous personality in the universe, who distributes kṛṣṇa-bhakti in all places [throughout the world].

His intense desire is that the name of Śrī Gaurāṅga be spread throughout Western countries, that in all the cities, towns, and villages on Earth, extending to all the seas, rivers, and streams, everyone chant śrī kṛṣṇa-nāma.

Transcendental bliss will then arise, and all directions will be conquered by the profuse mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. All those who are wicked, having been influenced by māyā and distressed within this world, will become happy. The Vaiṣṇavas’ desires will thus be fulfilled.

[O Kṛṣṇa!] Although I have been ordered to accomplish this mission, I possess no qualification to do it, being very fallen and incapable. Since You are the wisest of all, I now beg for Your mercy so that I may become worthy.

If, by receiving Your potency, I obtain the treasured object of service to śrī guru and my life becomes thus successful, I will become joyful and by good fortune attain Your association.

“Thus, by associating with material desires one after another, I was following the general populace by falling into a blind well full of snakes. My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead! Then the great sage Nārada Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple, and instructed me how to achieve the transcendental position similar to his own. How could I ever leave the service of your servant?” ©BBT

[O Kṛṣṇa!] You are my eternal companion. Having forgotten You, I have suffered the kick of māyā, lifetime after lifetime. Now I have the opportunity to serve You once more. If I can revive a connection with You, then I will be able to actually meet with You.

In Your company, dear friend, I will experience that same joy once again. I will wander all day long, tending the cows. I will run throughout the many forests and roll on the ground. Oh, when will that day be mine?

Today that remembrance of You came to me spontaneously. Feeling great hope, I called out to You. Only because I am Your eternal servant do I have so much longing. I have no refuge other than You.`
