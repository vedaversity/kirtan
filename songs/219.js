    "en": `Alas, alas! When will the two brothers Gaura-Nitāi bestow Their abundant mercy upon this most fallen person and show Them­selves to him?

By the power of Their mercy, I shall see the transcendental splendor of Vraja in Navadvīpa. I shall behold the enchanting Ānanda-sukhada-kuñja, with greedy eyes.

Near to Ānanda-sukhada-kuñja is Śrī Lalitā-kuṇḍa, surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of bejewelled sitting places where Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa expand the incessant revelry of Their pastimes.

All of Their sakhīs are there to assist in these pastimes, realizing the joy of rendering various kinds of sevā. This maidservant is also present, running here and there to carry out her duties on the order of her sakhī.

Stringing a garland of mālatī flowers, I shall bring it and place it in the hands of my sakhī. She will place it around the necks of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and I shall dance, filled with ecstasy.`
