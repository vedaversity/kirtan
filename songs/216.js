    "en": `Having fallen into this dreadful material world, a human being finds no end to his miseries. If he takes the association of devotees and serves Śrī Hari, then his sufferings will cease.

His heart is burning in the fire of material existence, which is continually increasing on its own. Chanting the names of Kṛṣṇa while avoiding offenses pours water on that fire.

Kṛṣṇadāsa says, “He who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Nitāi-Caitanya is my shelter in life and in death.”`
