    "en": `The noble Nityānanda Prabhu, the personification of supreme transcendental bliss, is never angry. Devoid of all false ego, He wanders throughout the town.

Going from door to door among the residences of lowly and fallen souls, He freely distributes the harināma mahā-mantra.

Holding a straw in His teeth, He calls out to whomever He sees, “Please purchase Me by calling out ‘Gaurahari!’ ”

Speaking in this way, Nityānanda Prabhu rolls on the ground, appearing like a golden mountain tumbling in the dust.

Locana dāsa says, “That sinful person who has not experienced the awakening of attachment for such an avatāra simply comes and goes [in the endless cycle of birth and death].”`
