    "en": `Having surrendered everything at Your lotus feet, I remain prostrated at Your house. You are my Lord. Kindly accept me as Your dog.

Tether me nearby and maintain me. I shall keep watch at Your door. I shall not allow any antagonistic persons to enter and will keep them outside Your fortress.

Whatever remnants Your devotees leave behind after honoring Your prasāda will be my sustenance. Daily, I will feast on those remnants in supreme bliss.

Whether sitting up or lying down, I will constantly meditate upon Your lotus feet. Whenever You call, I will come to You, dancing in joy.

I shall never think about my own maintenance; rather, I shall remain absorbed in bhāva. Bhaktivinoda accepts You as his sole maintainer.`
