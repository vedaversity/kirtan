    "en": `One day, Gaurahari left the Gundicha Temple and sat in the Jagannath Vallabha garden. It was pure Ekadasi, and the Lord spent the whole day and night chanting the Name of Krsna.

Svarupa Damodara, Ramananda Raya, Vakresvara Pandit, and the other devotees residing in Sri Ksetra were there with Him. The Lord said, \"Single-mindedly chant the Name of Krsna and avoid sleeping and eating.

Some of you should chant japa, some of you should offer obeisances, and some of you should speak about Balaram and Krsna.\" Bowing wherever they were, everyone chanted, \"Govinda! Govinda!\" and became completely intoxicated with intense divine love.

At that time, Gopinatha Acharya, Tulasi Padichha, and Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya brought prasad from the Gundicha Temple. They placed rice, vegetables, pancakes, sherbert, sweet rice, yoghurt, and curd before Mahaprabhu.

On the Lord’s order, everyone bowed down and offered prayers to the mahaprasad. Then they spent the entire night earnestly chanting the Name, immersed in intense divine love.

Holding the Lord’s order on their heads, everyone bathed in the morning, and then broke their fast by honouring the mahaprasad. With joyful hearts and joined palms, the devotees then made an appeal at the feet of the Lord.

\"We know that the crown jewel of all rites is to stay awake all night without food or water on the day of the Lord. We also know that in Sri Ksetra, Jagannath’s prasad should be honoured at all times and should be eaten whenever it is received.

We live in Sri Ksetra and are very afraid because of this dilemma, so we pray that You give us a clear instruction. All the Vedas are Your instructions, and Brahma and Siva follow them. Please put an end to our confusion by giving us an instruction\"

The Lord said, \"Failing to observe the practice of Ekadasi leads to total ruination. If you worship the prasad (on Ekadasi) and take it the following day, you will cross over this dilemma because the period of Ekadasi always ends the next day.

On the day of the Lord, pure devotees are satisfied by drinking the rasa of Krsna’s Name. They do not partake of any other rasa or speak about anything else. They avoid all forms of enjoyment.

Taking prasad is a daily activity of pure devotees; they do not eat anything that is not prasad. On pure Ekadasi, however, they fast and then take prasad to break their fast (the following day).

Devotees should know for certain that non-grain prasad is the only supplement acceptable on Ekadasi. Non-devotees enjoy day and night using prasad as an excuse. Lightheartedly, they eat grains in which the personification of sin is present and disregard the rite for the day of the Lord.

Everyone should devoutly honour and properly perform the practices of devotion. Then they will attain the grace of Bhakti Devi. So, reject the association of non-devotees and follow the Ekadasi rite by following the rite of chanting the Name. Then your observance of Ekadasi will be successful.

Understand within your heart that honouring prasad and honouring the day of the Lord never conflict.

Those who follow one practice of devotion but disregard the others are foolish. Know this for certain.

Sincerely devote yourself to each practice according to its place, time, rules, and rites.

Krsna is the enjoyer of all devotional practices, so adhere to what pleases Him.

On the day of Ekadasi, give up sleep and food, and on the following day, fully honour prasad and the other remnants of the Lord.\"

Knowing service to the Name and the Ekadasi rite to be eternally one, practise them both.`
