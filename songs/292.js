    "en": `That person's birth is successful if, by good fortune, he has Kṛṣṇa's darśana just once. By seeing Kṛṣṇa with the opened eyes of the heart, the jīva abandons all perversions of consciousness.

Bedecked with garlands of forest flowers, He [Kṛṣṇa] expertly engages in amorous enjoyment in Vṛndāvana. Standing in His threefold bending form and holding His flute, He displays unparalleled beauty. He is an ocean of nectarean mellows and a reservoir of all good qualities.

His bodily complexion is the color of a fresh rain cloud, He wears a great peacock feather on His head, and His forehead is beautifully decorated with marks of sandalwood paste. Wearing yellow garments and smiling sweetly, He maddens the whole world with His beauty.

When I see that form of Kṛṣṇa, whose beauty defeats the dark blue indranīla jewel (sapphire), standing under a kadamba tree, my mind becomes unsteady. My feet cannot move, and I forget my material existence.

O sakhī! His sweet form is full of nectar. If the eyes behold that form, one falls unconscious and tears of love stream from them.

How wonderful is the peacock-feather crown on His head! How wonderful is the flute in His hands! How wonderful is His three-fold bending form! His lotus feet overflow with nectar and are bound with ankle bells.

I always desire to take the form of a bee and attain shelter at His lotus feet. I shall readily sing of Kṛṣṇa’s glories and never worship any other.`
