    "en": `All glories to the son of Mother Yaśodā, Kṛṣṇa, who maintains and gives pleasure to the cows, gopas, and gopīs. All glories to the enchanter of Cupid, Hari, who is infinite and awards salvation.

All glories to the infallible Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, the reservoir of all pleasure, and the moon of Vṛndāvana. All glories to He who holds a flute to His lips, whose complexion is like a beautiful dark blue rain cloud, and who is the bliss of the gopīs.`
