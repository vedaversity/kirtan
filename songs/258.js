    "en": `Millions of lovely cowherd damsels are unable to keep Mādhava’s attention, despite their great endeavor to do so.

The flute song calls the name of Rādhikā. “Come here, come here, Rādhe!” petitions Śyāma.

When He goes in search of Śrī Rādhā, the rāsa dance comes to a halt. 

Exclaiming, “O Rādha, please save My life by giving Me Your darśana!” Kāna weeps in the forest.

Embracing Śrī Rādhā and reconciling with Her in a secluded grove, Śrī Hari revives His life. 

He says, “Without You, what is the question of performing rāsa? Only because of You do I live in Vraja.”

Weeping at the lotus feet of this Rādhikā, Bhaktivinoda says:

“Count me among Your personal associates and keep me as Your maidservant.”`
