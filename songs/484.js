    "en": `I do not know by what strength I have come to attain shelter of You within Your dhāma. Truly, You are most benevolent, devoted to sanctifying and delivering the fallen.

I rest all my hopes simply in the fact, O Lord, that You are saturated with compassion. There is no beneficiary more in want of Your compassion than I. You will indeed subjugate all my fears.

There is no one in the world with the power to deliver me. O merciful Lord, by Your decree, please save this lowly and sinful soul.

Leaving everything behind, O Protector, I have settled at Your feet. I am Your eternal servant, and You are my sustainer and custodian,  O Jagannātha (Lord of the universe)!

Everything is Yours, and I am simply Your servant. You shall deliver me. I have accepted Your feet as my only shelter. I do not even belong to myself.

Weeping, Bhaktivinoda has taken refuge at Your feet. Please forgive my offenses and give me a taste for the holy name. Maintain me in this way.`
