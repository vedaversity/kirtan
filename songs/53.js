    "en": `The hue of His body is the charming color of sapphire. His ears are graced by blossoming kadamba flowers, and His broad chest is adorned with a guñjā-mālā. All glories to beautiful Kuñja-bihārī!

He is the cakora bird who drinks the rays emanating from the moon of Śrī Rādhā’s face. He steals away the composure of all the chaste brides of the gopas and He skillfully dances to the rhythm known as carcarī. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

Putting an end to the renowned customary worship of Indra (as was performed by the cowherds of Vraja), He removed Indra’s pride, and to protect the people of Vraja (from Indra’s wrath), He playfully lifted Govardhana Hill. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

His vaṁśī is decorated with different rāgas and rāginīs, by which He announces (to the gopīs) the festival of transcendental Cupid. (Hearing the sweet sound of that vaṁśī,) flocks of enamoured male and female parrots extol His character. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

His beautiful garments have the splendor of gold. The top of His head is decorated with a peacock feather, and He delights the girls of Vraja, who shine with ever-fresh youth. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

He is anointed with fragrant sandal paste. His hips are decorated with a golden belt. He is the elephant bound by the rope of the raised breasts of Śrī Rādhikā. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

His forehead is made splendid with tilaka ground from golden minerals. His campaka garland playfully sways to and fro. He goes to mountain caves for a tryst (abhisāra) with the beautiful-eyebrowed gopīs. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

His restless, dancing sidelong glances make the gopīs drop all their household duties. He is the paramour of Vṛṣabhānu’s daughter, who is mad with love for Him. All glories to Kuñja-bihārī!

He who recites these eight verses about the sweet, playful pastimes of Kuñja-bihārī will certainly attain the greatest fortune, anurāga for the worship of His lotus feet.`
