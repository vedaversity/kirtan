    "en": `Please bestow your mercy, O Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura; by knowing my relationship with Śrī Kṛṣṇa and constantly engaging in bhajana, my false ego will thus be dispelled.

If I develop the idea that ‘I am a Vaiṣṇava,’ then I will never become humble. My heart will become contaminated with the desire to receive honor from others, and I shall go to hell.

I will know myself to be your servant, having given up the false conception of being guru. With sincerity, I shall always honor your remnants, the water that has washed your feet, and the dust of your feet.

If I consider myself to be superior to all and give my remnants and so forth to others, the weight of my false pride will become very heavy. Thus, always remaining [in the mood of] your disciple, I will not accept worship from others.

If I renounce the desire for honor for myself and instead offer respect to others, you will give me the qualification to perform kīrtana. Without duplicity, I shall cry and roll on the ground at your lotus feet.`
