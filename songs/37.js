    "en": `O Śrīmatī Rādhikā, who are glorified by great sages! O You who dispel the lamentation of the three worlds, whose lotus face blossoms with a humorous smile, and who sports in the kuñjas. O beloved daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu! O most near and dear to the son of the king of Vraja, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You who are present in a pavilion made of creepers that are entwined around aśoka trees, whose beautiful, tender reddish feet have the luster of coral and newly sprouting reddish leaves, and whose [raised] hand grants benedictions and fearlessness. O abode of infinite opulence, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You who, on the stage of amorous sports, in the course of an auspicious discussion, express amazement by curving Your eyebrows like bows and then suddenly firing the arrows of Your sidelong glances, piercing the son of Śrī Nanda with amorous delusion and bringing Him under Your perpetual control, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You whose radiant and fair form resembles lightening, gold, and campaka flowers, whose lotus face defeats the splendor of the effulgence of millions of autumnal moons, and whose eyes, restless like those of a young cakora bird, make various astonishing expressions at each moment, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You who are intoxicated by Your youthfulness, who are decorated with the delightful ornament of sulky anger, who revels in Your lover’s attachment to You, and who are supremely proficient in the art of loving affairs. O You who are the most learned in knowledge of loving sports within the realm of Your confidential, auspicious forest groves, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You who are decorated with the ornaments of anubhāva, such as hāva and bhāva, and a diamond necklace of gentleness and gravity, whose breasts are like water pots made of pure gold and which resemble the twin mounds on the head of an elephant. O You whose glorious, gentle smile is like an ocean full of bliss, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You whose arms are like the tender stems of a lotus swaying in the water’s waves, whose glance from blue eyes resembles the tips of creepers dancing in the breeze, who allure Mana-mohana to follow You, and upon meeting Him, steal away His mind and give Him shelter in His state of enchantment, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You whose neck is marked with three lines like a conch shell and is adorned with golden necklaces and an auspicious tri-sūtra, glowing with three kinds of brilliant gems. O You whose bluish-black tresses, interwoven in a braid with clusters of flower blossoms, sway to and fro, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You from whose rounded hips hangs a wreath of excellent flowers, on whose charming slender waist a sublime belt of tiny bejewelled bells sweetly rings, and whose beautiful thighs taper like the sloping trunk of the king of elephants, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You whose ankle bells, sweetly resounding with a host of Vedic mantras, resemble the warbling of a flock of royal swans, and whose beautiful gait mocks the movements of a swaying golden creeper, will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O You who are worshiped by Lakṣmī-devī—the mistress of unlimited Vaikuṇṭha planets—and who bestows benedictions upon Śrī Pārvatī, Indrāṇī, and Sarasvatī, even one of the nails on Your lotus feet gives rise to an infinite variety of spiritual perfections. Oh, when will You make me the recipient of Your merciful sidelong glance?

O Mistress of all kinds of sacrifices, of all activities, of the mantras uttered during yajña, of all the gods, of the teachings of the three Vedas, of the enforcement of all scriptural principles, of the goddess of fortune, of forgiveness, and of the delightful forest [of Vṛndāvana], O Mistress and Empress of Vraja, O Śrīmatī Rādhikā, I offer my praṇāma unto You.

O daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, upon hearing this wonderful prayer, please make me qualified to perpetually receive Your merciful sidelong glance. By Your mercy my three types of karma  will be destroyed, and at that moment I will enter the circle of the son of the king of Vraja and His dearmost sakhīs.`
