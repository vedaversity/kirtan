dei tulasī tila,    deha samarpinu,

gaṇaite doṣa,    guṇaleśa nā pāobi,
ʝava tuhu̐ karabi vicāra
tuhu̐ jagannātha,    jagate kahāosi,
jaga-bāhira nahi mũi chāra

kiẏe mānuṣa paśu-,    pākhī ʝe janamiẏe,
athavā kīṭa-pataṅge
karama-vipāke,    gatāgati punaḥ punaḥ,
mati rahu tuẏā parasaṅge

bhaṇaẏe vidyāpati,    atiśaẏa kātara,
taraite iha bhavasindhu
tuẏā padapallava,    kari avalambana,
tila eka deha dīnabandhu`,

    "en": `O Mādhava, I ardently solicit You! Offering tulasī and sesame, I submit my very body before You. I know that You are merciful and will not reject me.

Encountering only my faults, You will not find a speck of good qualities when considering my appeal. You are known throughout the world as Jagannātha (Lord of the Universe); therefore, even a contemptible person like me is not beyond Your consideration.

Impelled by my karma, I may take birth as a human, as an animal, as a bird, or even as a worm or bug. Again and again reaping the consequences of my actions, I tumble about from one fate to the next. Nonetheless, may my absorption remain in You.

In acute desperation, Vidyāpati supplicates: “In traversing this ocean of material existence, the tender leaves of Your feet are my sole mainstay. Allow me just a morsel of Your grace, O friend of the lowly.`
