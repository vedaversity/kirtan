    "en": `I cannot tolerate Rādhikā’s condition in separation from Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus I am fully prepared to give up my life for the sake of Their happy reunion.

If I were to renounce Rādhikā’s lotus feet for even an instant, I would become totally devastated. For Rādhikā’s sake, I would tolerate the agony of death hundreds of times.

When shall I attain the service of Śrī Rādhā’s lotus feet? O residents of Vraja, when will you be merciful to me and take me into the forests of Vraja?

O Vilāsa Mañjarī, Anaṅga Mañjarī, and Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī! Lift me up and bring me close to your lotus feet, thus granting me the ultimate perfection.`
