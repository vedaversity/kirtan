    "en": `All glories to the son of Nanda Mahārāja, the beloved of the gopīs and the hero of Rādhā, the gallant Śyāma. That [very same] son of Śacī is the monarch of Nadīyā and the abode of all beauty who enchants the minds of the gods and sages.

All glories to He who has adorned His body with His own beloved’s radiant luster. All glories, all glories to He who takes pleasure in the bhāvas of His dearest one. All glories to He who brings auspiciousness to the eyes of the maidens of Vraja. All glories to He who delights the eyes of the residents of Nadīyā.

All glories, all glories to Śrīdāma, Sudāmā, Subala, and Arjuna, whose forms are like new rain clouds that increase the ocean of prema. All glories to Ramāi Paṇḍita, Śrīvāsa, and their beautiful brothers, all of whom are dear companions of Mahāprabhu. All glories to the incomparable Gaura, who captivates the entire universe.

All glories to the exceedingly powerful Balarāma’s dear younger brother (Kṛṣṇa). All glories, all glories to He who is the bliss of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu (Gaurāṅga). All glories, all glories to these two, who eradicate the fears of the devotees. Govinda dāsa’s hopes and aspirations start with Them.`
