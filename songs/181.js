    "en": `If Śrī Gaurāṅga had not appeared, then what would have become of us? How would we have survived? Who could have taught the world about the glories of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the topmost limit of prema-rasa?

Who would have had true insight to enter the sweet rapture of the forest of Vṛndā-devī and the power to render loving service in the mood of the damsels of Vraja?

With a simple heart, always sing about Gaurāṅga’s glorious qualities. I cannot see even one person as compassionate as He in this ocean of material existence.

Even though I chant ‘Gaurāṅga’, my heart has not melted. How do I continue to maintain this body? How has Narahari been created with a stone in place of a heart?`
