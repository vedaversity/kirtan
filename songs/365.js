    "en": `Our Śrī Gaurahari came chanting, “Hari! Hari!”

Śrī Gaurāṅga-cā̃da came looking greatly disheveled, as if mad, due to prema. Along with Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Ācārya, He entered the land of Godruma.

Intoxicated by saṅkīrtana-rasa, He freely distributed the holy name to everyone. He arrived at the marketplace of the holy name and inundated the entire universe with prema.

Today, all miseries of the residents of Godruma have gone away because Śrī Gaurāṅga, having come with all His devotees, opened the marketplace of the holy name.

Wandering all over the land of Nadīyā, Śrī Gaurāṅga came to the marketplace of the holy name. Śrī Gaura came to the marketplace along with Nitāi.

Maddened with ecstasy, Nitāi dances in the fields of Godruma. Due to prema, Nitāi moves His powerful arms like a challenging wrestler and thus overwhelms the universe in rapture.

All of you come and see! The Vaiṣṇavas, headed by Advaita Ācārya, are dancing along the banks of the Gaṅgā, going from one ghāṭa to the next. At such a sight, the wicked personality Kali falls into great distress and runs for his life.

Oh, in what indescribable happiness did all the jīvas float while Śrī Gaura-candra was dancing! By seeing and hearing such pastimes, the hearts of the atheists shatter.`
