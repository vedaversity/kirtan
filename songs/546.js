    "en": `There is no one in this world as wretched as I am. Having fallen into the vast ocean of material existence, I have become most agitated.

O Yogamāyā, O worshipful goddess of the Vaiṣṇavas, O mother of the universe, when will you bestow your mercy and lift your veil [of Mahāmāyā]?

I have heard your glories from the Vedic literatures. You bind the souls who are averse to Kṛṣṇa and make them engage in worldly life.

To that person who, through the gradual dawning of good fortune, develops a favorable disposition toward Śrī Kṛṣṇa, you grant liberation and make him free from lamentation and fear.

O Mother, please show your causeless mercy to this servant and grant me shelter in Vṛndāvana, for you are Yogamāyā herself.

By disregarding you, how can the jīvas attain Śrī Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa manifested his rāsa-līlā pastimes only by your mercy.

You are an eternal companion of Śrī Kṛṣṇa and the mother of the universe. You have shown me the transcendental wish-fulfilling jewel of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

O Mother, please glance upon me without reservation, so that my faith in the Vaiṣṇavas may increase at every moment.

Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of Vaiṣṇavas, Bhaktivinoda is not able to cross the ocean of material existence.`
