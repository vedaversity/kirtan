    "en": `Through the lips of Śrī Rūpa, the beautiful son of Śacī propagated the glories of His own name.

Śrī Hari's name is Śrī Hari Himself; there is no distinction. His name is Absolute Truth; this fact is sung in the Vedas.

A the Upaniṣads glitter at His (Śrī Nāma’s) feet like a necklace of gemstones. From moment to moment, they perform maṅgala-ārati with ten lamps. 

In all the fourteen realms of existence, those gods, men, and demons whose fortunes are robust incessantly drink the elixir of nectar that is His name, abandoning all pursuits of action or knowledge.

Furthermore, [above these beings] the eternally liberated eternally worship His name with hymns and songs. Sitting in the transcendental realm of Goloka, they sing His name without cease; thus they do not know the absence of His name.

Those two syllables ‘ha’ and ‘ri’ are the abode of all nectar. All the mellows of the devotion have take shelter there. At the feet of Śrī Nāma, Bhaktivinoda says, “I beg refuge at your feet.”`
