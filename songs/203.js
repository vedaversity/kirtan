    "en": `O my dear brother, just worship the lotus feet of my Lord Gaurāṅga! Because I have not performed such worship, I am dying of sorrow. Having plunged into the poisonous well of household life, my five life-airs are burning.

Day and night, my heart burns in the blazing poisonous fire of the threefold miseries of material existence. Thus, my body repeatedly falls unconscious. My senses subjugated by the cardinal vices [of lust, anger, greed, etc.,] I have forgotten the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurāṅga and remain averse to that great treasure.

Leaving aside all your fears and hesitation, take shelter of the merciful Śrī Gaurāṅga, with both body and mind. Because He has rescued those who are most wicked and sinful, He is known as patita-pābana, savior of the fallen.

If you bind Śrī Gaurāṅga, the king of the brāhmaṇas and the best of dancers, within your heart, then what will material existence and death be able to do to you? Narottama dāsa says, “There is no one equal to Śrī Gaurāṅga. Even without being worshiped, He bestows the treasure of prema.”`
