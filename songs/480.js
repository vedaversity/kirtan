    "en": `Mind, body, family, and whatever else is mine, I have surrendered at Your lotus feet, O youthful son of Nanda! In good fortune and in bad, in life and in death, all my difficulties have absconded by accepting those feet of Yours [as my shelter].

Slay me or protect me as You wish, for You have ownership of Your eternal servant.

If it is Your will that I be born again, then may that birth be in the home of Your devotee.

May I even take birth as a worm, as long as I remain Your devotee. I have no desire for a birth as a Brahmā averse to You.

I yearn for the association of that devotee who is completely devoid of all desires for worldly enjoyment and liberation.

Father, mother, beloved, son, lord, preceptor, and husband—You are everything to me.

Bhaktivinoda says, “O Kāna, please hear me! O Lord of Rādhā, You are my very life and soul!”`
