    "en": `His sublime body is brilliant with a golden hue, and He incessantly performs pastimes, overwhelmed by transcendental moods (the bhāvas of Śrīmatī Rādhikā). A minute particle of His mercy purifies all the three worlds. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

Within His heart, transformations of bhāvas cause His voice to falter. His great roar strikes terror in the hearts of atheists, and His compassion nullifies the fear evoked by mundane existence. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

He wears cloth the saffron hue of the rising sun, and His cheeks are charming. His fingernails and toenails radiate a brilliance that eclipses the glory of the full moon, and He receives immense bliss by performing the kīrtana of His own names and virtues. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

Streams of tears flow from His lotus eyes. His body is adorned with ever new transformations of bhāva, and in His pastimes of dance, His movements flow most gently. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

The restless movements of His beautiful feet are very attractive. Those two sweet feet are adorned with delightful, tinkling ankle bells.  His cooling face reproaches the moon. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

Around His waist, He wears a cloth belt for kaupīnas (ḍora), and He holds a kamaṇḍalu and a daṇḍa. His divine body is crowned with a shaven head. With His daṇḍa, He vanquishes the sins of the wicked. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

His curling locks of hair are ornamented by the dust of the earth (which rises as He dances), and His captivating lips, crimson like bimba fruit, quiver. His body is adorned with bright tilaka made of Malaya sandalwood. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.

The shape of His eyes challenges the elongated form of a reddish lotus petal. His beautiful arms extend down to His knees, and His form is graced with the attire of a youthful dancer. I offer praṇāma to the beautiful son of Mother Śacī.`
