    "en": `O Hari! When will I recognize who is a Vaiṣṇava? The lotus feet of the Vaiṣṇava are a mine of all auspiciousness. I will become maddened by holding them within my heart.

The worshipful Vaiṣṇava is always transcendental, without faults, and full of bliss. He has deep affection for Kṛṣṇa’s name, he is indifferent to mundane affairs, and he melts with compassion for the living beings.

The Vaiṣṇava is free from false ego, expert in bhajana, and detached from sense-objects. He is free of duplicity, internally and externally, and he is filled with loving attachment to the Lord’s eternal pastimes.

There are three types of Vaiṣṇavas—kaniṣṭha, madhyama, and uttama—and they are distinguished by their characteristics. I have heard [from authorities] that one should give affection to the kaniṣṭha-vaiṣṇava, offer respectful obeisances to the madhyama-vaiṣṇava, and fully serve the uttama-vaiṣṇava.

When I recognize Vaiṣṇavas according to their qualifications and thus duly honor them, I shall certainly receive their mercy, which is the source of all success.

Bhaktivinoda never speaks to those who, out of envy, criticize the ever-pure character of Vaiṣṇavas; instead, he always remains silent.`
