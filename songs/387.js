dīna daẏāmaẏa karuṇā-nidāna
bhāvabindu dei rākhaha parāṇa

kabe tava nāma uccāraṇe mora
naẏane jharaba daradara lora

gadagada-svara kaṇṭhe upajaba
mukhe bola ādha ādha bāhirāba

pulake bharaba śarīra hāmāra
sveda-kampa-stambha habe bārabāra

vivarṇa-śarīre hārāoba jñāna
nāma-samāśraẏe dharabu̐ parāṇa

milaba hāmāra kie aiche dina
roẏe bhaktivinoda matihīna`,

    "en": `Due to my offenses, my heart has become hard like a bolt of lightning and feels no transformation from chanting Your name. Downcast, O Hari, I cry out Your name again and again in great distress.

O You who are merciful to the fallen! O root cause of compassion! Please give me a drop of bhāva and save my life.

When will tears flow continuously from my eyes upon uttering Your holy name?

My throat then choked, only stuttered half-syllables will issue from my mouth.

My whole body shall be covered in goose bumps, and I shall perspire, tremble, and become stunned again and again.

My body becoming pale, I shall lose consciousness and then hold onto my life by taking shelter of the holy name.

Bhaktivinoda, who is devoid of intelligence, weeps, “O Lord, will I ever encounter such a day?”`
