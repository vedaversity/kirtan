    "en": `O Govardhana Mahārāja! Your head is adorned with a beautiful crown.

From your ears dangle dazzling earrings, and from your neck hangs a splendid vaijayantī garland.

Upon your lips rests the muralī flute, and upon your chin a red ruby shines.

Your body is covered with a saffron-colored tunic and a reddish-pink cādara.

You are presented with betel nuts, flowers, and lit ghee-lamps, day and night.

Mānasī-gaṅgā flows near you, and you are bathed in a shower of milk.

Your seven kosa (fourteen mile) parikramā is completed at Cakaleśvara.`
