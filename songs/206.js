    "en": `O mind, just speak about Gaura. Gaura’s name is the abode of nectar and the embodiment and bestower of divine love.

In sleep, there is Gaura; in dreams, there is Gaura—Gaura is the star of my eyes. In life, there is Gaura; in death, there is Gaura. Gaura is a most precious necklace.

Keeping Gaurāṅga inside my heart, I will sit in a secluded place and, according to my heart’s desire, I will keep my eyes fixed on His moon-like form.

Without Gaura I cannot live. I have made Gaura the essence of my existence. May my life be spent chanting the name of Gaura. I do not desire anything else.

Gaura’s movement, Gaura’s appearance, Gaura’s smiling face, Gaura’s love, and Gaura’s form––all penetrate my heart.

Gaura is my dharma, Gaura is [the object of] my karma, and Gaura is the essence of the Vedas. I surrender my life at Gaura’s lotus feet. Gaura will take me across [the ocean of material existence].

Narahari dāsa begs for shelter at the feet of the servant of the servant of that person in whose heart the sound of ‘Gaura’ and the treasure of Gaura has manifested.`
