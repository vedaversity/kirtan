    "en": `O daughter of Vṛṣabhānu, Śrī Rādhikā! I offer my obeisances to Your lotus feet, which are the treasured object of lotus-eyed Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s vision.

Glistening like spotless mirrors, Your toenails put to shame the brilliance of millions of moons, thus enchanting the cakora bird of Śrī Mādhava’s heart.

Lakṣmī-devī forever sings the glories of Your lotus feet, which are beautified by auspicious marks. The sakhīs headed by Śrī Lalitā-devī annoint Your feet by hand with crimson pigment.

Giridhārī-Kṛṣṇa carefully serves Your lotus feet, which always decorate His thoughts. Your lotus feet are expert in expanding the flow of rasa by dancing in the rāsa-līlā.`
