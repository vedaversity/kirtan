    "en": `The lotus feet of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī are my treasure. They are [the sole object of] my bhajana and worship. Her lotus feet are the wealth of my life. They are the ornament of my life and, indeed, the very life of my life.

Her lotus feet are the treasure-house of rasa, the attainment of my desires, and the conclusion of all the Vedas. Her lotus feet are the goal of my vows and austerities, the object of my recitation of mantra, and the purpose of all my religious activities.

When Providence becomes favorable, I shall attain Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī’s lotus feet and behold them with these two eyes. The abundant sweet beauty of Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī’s lotus feet will shine like the moon upon the blue lotus of my heart, causing it to blossom in jubilation both day and night.

Your absence from my vision is like a snake that has corroded my body with poison. The remaining days of my life will pass in the burning fire of separation. Alas, O Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, be merciful and give me the shade of your lotus feet. There, Narottama is taking shelter.`
