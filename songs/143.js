nitāi vihane mora āra nāhi gati

ʝe-deśe nitāi nāi, se-deśe nā ʝā’ba
nitāi-vimukha-janāra mukha nā heriba

gaṅgā ʝā̐’ra padajala, hara śire dhare
hena nitāi nā bhajiẏā duḥkha peẏe mare

locana bale mora nitāi ʝebā nāhi māne
anala bhejāi tā’ra mājha-mukhakhāne`,

    "en": `Nitāi is the wealth of my life. Nitāi is my family. But for Nitāi, I have no resort.

I shall throw ash in the face of worldly pleasure. While chanting the name of Nitāi, I shall sustain my life by begging in the village.

I shall never visit any place where Nitāi is absent, and I shall never look upon the face of one who is averse to Him.

The water that bathes Nitāi’s feet is the same Gaṅgā that Lord Śiva bears upon his head. One who does not worship this Nitāi will suffer and die.

Locana dāsa declares, “I shall scorch the face of one who has no regard for my Nitāi!”`
