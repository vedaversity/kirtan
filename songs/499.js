    "en": `Why are you plunging into the net of māyā, O fish-like jīva? You do not realize that you will remain trapped perpetually.

Imprisoned in the net of māyā due to your desire for utterly insignificant pleasures, you remain in a vitiated condition, punished like an oppressed servant.

Now, remain subservient to Kṛṣṇa, and on the strength of bhakti, sport freely in the waters of the ocean of kṛṣṇa-prema.`
