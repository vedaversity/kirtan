    "en": `You became like an umbrella on the handle of your Lord’s arm, thus obliterating the pride of Devarāja Indra, who had become impudent, intoxicated by his own majesty. You are without comparison, the great king of mountains. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

The youthful Divine Couple perform delightful amorous pastimes within each and every one of your caves. Thus, since you facilitate the witnessing of Their līlās, O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

Upon your incomparable gem-studded platforms and jeweled thrones, in your broad open spaces, in the shade of your trees, by your waterfalls and streams, upon your crests, and in your valleys, your dear Śrī Kṛṣṇa, accompanied by Balarāma and all the sakhās, enjoys playful sports. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

Upon witnessing the dāna-keli-līlā (playful tax pastime) of the Youthful Couple, who are a treasure-house of rasa, you manifested a fragrant, lustrous, black raised platform [in order to facilitate that sweet līlā]. Thus you increase the joy of exalted rasika devotees. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

Unprecedented Rādhā-kuṇḍa is most dear to Śrī Hari and is also your dear friend. Playfully embracing Rādhā-kuṇḍa to your neck, you remain hidden there while watching the ever-youthful Divine Couple enjoy sportive pastimes in that secret place. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

With your fields, ponds, roots, grass, and the shade of your trees, you nourish the cows at every moment. In this way, you make your name successful and known throughout the three worlds. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the enemy of Aghāsura and Bakāsura, showed you great honor, turning you into a new home by holding you aloft, thus protecting the vrajavāsīs from the deep hostility of Indra. Without delay, O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

O Girirāja! Your sweet title haridāsa-varya (best of the servants of Śrī Hari) issued from the moon-like face of Śrīmatī Rādhikā. The Vedas have clearly determined you to be the fresh tilaka of Vraja. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

You are absorbed in the mellow of friendship with Śrī Śrī Rādhā Kṛṣṇa and Their intimate associates. It is you alone who bestow happiness upon the men, women, animals, and birds of Vraja. Out of your unbounded kindness, accept me, who am full of distress. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

The causelessly merciful Śrī Śacīnandana, who is most dear to you, has offered me to you. Therefore, although I am deceitful and wicked, do not consider my qualification or lack thereof. O Govardhana, please give me residence by your side.

One who with careful intent recites these ten verses about Govardhana, lord of the dynasty of mountains, which bestow rasa, will at once attain joyful residence by his side and the auspicious jewel of direct service to the Divine Couple.`
