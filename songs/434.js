    "en": `Making your mind steady, worship Śrī Hari, and with your lips, chant His holy names: Vrajendra-nandana (son of the king of Vraja), Gopī-prāṇa-dhana (treasure of the life of the gopīs), and Śyāma (dark-complexioned one), whose beauty enchants the entire universe.

When will you die? How will you be delivered? The fearsome lord of death, at whose power the universe quakes, is calling. You do not realize the mortal danger.

Intoxicated by your high birth and wealth, you think yourself very great. Yet the messengers of the lord of death will render you inert by capturing you and binding your hands and feet.

Whether one is renounced, chaste, or low-caste, if he does not worship Śrī Hari, then he will take birth, wander within the material world, and drown in the hell known as Raurava.

This Locana dāsa always contemplates how his life has passed in vain. I have not worshiped Śrī Hari; rather I have absorbed myself in sense enjoyment, and thus a spear pierces my heart.`
