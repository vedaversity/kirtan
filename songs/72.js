    "en": `After Kṛṣṇa killed Vṛṣabhāsura, Śrīmatī Rādhikā said to Him, “O Vṛṣabha-śatru! You are approaching us, but don’t touch us!” Hearing these words, with a single blow from His heel Kṛṣṇa manifested Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa. May that Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, be my shelter.

Having been called there by Śrī Kṛṣṇa, all the sin-vanquishing holy places within the three worlds began residing together within Śyāma-kuṇḍa, thereby broadcasting the extensive glories of that place. May that Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, be my shelter.

“He Kṛśāṅgi Rādhe! You please also bathe in the pristine waters of this purifying pond which is now a beautiful holy place”—with these words Śrī Kṛṣṇa implored even Śrīmatī Rādhikā to bathe in Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa. May that Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, be my shelter.

Seeing how Kṛṣṇa’s ‘sin’ of killing Vṛṣabhāsura was absolved by His bathing in this pond which is inhabited by all the holy places and which was manifest from a single blow of His heel, Vṛṣabhānu-nandinī Śrīmatī Rādhikā, accompanied by all Her sakhīs, mani­fested a similar pond nearby. Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, is my shelter.

After being forbidden by Śrīmatī Rādhikā to enter Her pond, the personified holy places became very fearful and humbly prostrat­ing themselves at Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra’s lotus feet, said, “Having been rejected by Śrīmatī Rādhikā, the sole shelter for the shelterless, what will be our destination?” May the pure waters of Śrī Śyāma-kuṇda, the place where this entreaty was spoken, be my shelter.

Upon seeing the distress of the personified holy places and desiring to bestow upon them the qualification to enter Śrīmatī Rādhikā’s pond, Śrī Kṛṣṇa displayed various bodily poses and facial expressions and appealed to Rādhikā with clever words. Then, very softly and courteously, Rādhikā replied that She was very pleased—may the pure waters of that Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa, where these words were spoken, be my shelter.

Then those holy places, which had assumed the form of water and entered Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa, pleased Śrīmatī Rādhikā with verses of exceptionally brilliant poetry and, upon attaining Her mercy, penetrated the land between the two kuṇḍas and entered the pond of the ever-fresh Youthful Lovers of Vraja, Śrī Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, is my sole shelter.

On the banks of Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa, Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Her sakhīs created kuñjas beautified by desire trees and burgeoning vines with varieties of flowers and then awarded those kuñjas to Subala, Madhumaṅgala, and the other primary sakhās. That Śrī Śyāma-kuṇḍa, composed of exceptionally pure water, is my shelter.

That intelligent person who regularly recites this Śyāma-kuṇḍāṣṭakam with great devotion will develop loving attraction for Vrajendra-nandana Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose complexion is like that of a fresh monsoon cloud and who is accompanied by Śrīmatī Rādhikā, whose complexion is like pure gold and who is always surrounded by Her sakhīs, thereby easily entering into Their worship and attaining Their eternal company very soon.`
