    "en": `O Gopīnātha, please remove the burning torment of worldly existence. I can no longer tolerate the pain of ignorance and the cycle of repeated birth and death.

O Gopīnātha, I am the servant of lust. The desire for mundane sense enjoyment has awakened in my heart and has ensnared me with the noose of fruitive activity.

O Gopīnātha, when will I wake up and cast the enemy of lust far away? At that time, You will manifest within my heart.

O Gopīnātha, I am actually Yours, but having left You to enjoy the material world, I have forgotten my real wealth.

O Gopīnātha, You certainly know everything. You may now punish this servant of Yours and kindly give me a place at Your divine lotus feet.

O Gopīnātha, is this Your judgment—that upon seeing he who is averse to You, You will abandon Your own servant without bestowing even a drop of mercy [upon him]?

O Gopīnātha, I am indeed a great fool, and I have never understood what is good for me. That is why I am in such a state.

O Gopīnātha, You are indeed the wisest person and will search for the means to bring auspiciousness to all the fools of the world. Do not consider this servant an outsider.`
