    "en": `In the beginning of creation Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the science of devotional service to Lord Brahmā. He in turn passed these teachings on to Śrī Nārada Muni,

who accepted Śrī Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva as his disciple. Śrī Vyāsa transmitted this knowledge to Śrī Madhvācārya, who is also known as Pūrṇaprajña Tīrtha and who is the sole refuge for his disciple Śrī Padmanābha Tīrtha.

Following forth from Śrī Madhvācārya were Nṛhari Tīrtha,

Śrī Mādhava Tīrtha, and then the swan-like Śrī Akṣobhya Tīrtha. The principal disciple of Śrī Akṣobhyatīrtha was known as Śrī Jayatīrtha, and Śrī Jñānasindhu was his servant.

The paramparā continued with Śrī Dayānidhi,

then his disciple Śrī Vidyānidhi, and next with Śrī Rājendra Tīrtha, whose servant was Śrī Jayadharma, also known as Śrī Vijayadhvaja Tīrtha. Know well that this is the guru-paramparā.

The sannyāsī Śrī Puruṣottama Tīrtha,

a renowned disciple in the service of Śrī Jayadharma, was succeeded by the erudite Śrī Brahmaṇya Tīrtha. Next in succession was Śrī Vyāsa Tīrtha, who was succeeded by Śrī Lakṣmīpati, who in turn was succeeded by Śrī Mādhavendra Purī.

The most prominent disciples of the great Śrī Mādhavendra Purī were Śrī Īśvara Purī and the avatāras Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrī Advaita Ācārya. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,

the Golden Lord and spiritual preceptor of all the worlds, made Īśvara Purī greatly fortunate by accepting him as His dīkṣā-guru.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu,

who is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa combined, is the very life of the rūpānuga Vaiṣṇavas (those who follow Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī). Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, Śrī Rūpa, and Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmīs were the dearmost servants of Lord Viśvambhara (Śrī Caitanya).

Dear to Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī were the great saintly personalities Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī,

whose intimate disciple was the great poet Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja. The dearmost of Kṛṣṇadāsa was Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, who was always engaged in guru-sevā. His lotus feet were the only hope and aspiration of Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.

Prominent among the associates of Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura was Śrī Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa. After him,

the line descended to Śrīla Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, who was the beloved śikṣā-guru of Śrī Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Bhaktivinoda was the intimate friend of the great mahā-bhāgavata Śrīla Gaura-kiśora dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, whose sole delight was hari-bhajana.

Śrī Vārṣabhānavī,

the daughter of Śrī Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja, is the best of Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s beloveds, as She is forever engaged in loving service to Her worshipful Lord. Śrī Vārṣabhānavī-dayita dāsa, the servant (dāsa) of  Her beloved (dayita) is the name of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda.

A confidential disciple of Śrīla Prabhupāda,

Śrīla Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja, was a faithful follower of Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. Through his knowledge of Gauḓīya Vedānta, he annihilated the darkness of ignorance spread by māyāvāda. He was the abode of preaching and practicing Śrī Gaurāṅga’s teachings (gauravāṇī) in his own life. Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja extensively preached this gauravāṇī and thus completely fulfilled the inner-heart’s desire of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda.

Most dear to Śrī Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī are the saintly personalities Śrī Bhaktivedānta Vāmana Gosvāmī and Śrī Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī,

whose life’s treasure is gauravāṇī. All of these devotees are the personal associates of Śrī Gaurāṅga. I desire to honor their ucchiṣṭa [the remnants of their lips, namely their mahā-prasāda as well as their instructions].`
