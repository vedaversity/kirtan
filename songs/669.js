ita nandako dulāro, uta bhānukī dulārī
jorī lāge ati pyārī vasi naẏananame̐

jamunāke kūla, pahira suraṅga dukūla
taise khila rahe phūla ina kadamaname̐

gaura śyāma raṅga, ghana dāminīke saṅga
bhaī akhiẏā̐ apaṅga chavi bharī maname̐

rādhā mukha aura, naina śyāmake cakora
sakhiẏana prema ḍora lagī caraṇaname̐`,

    "en": `Rādhā and Dāmodara are swinging back and forth on a swing in Vṛndāvana. O friend, how lush is the greenery in the forest bowers.

On one side is the dear son of Nanda, on the other side is the dear daughter of Vṛṣabhānu Mahārāja. They appear so charming together. I keep Them within my sight.

On the bank of the Yamunā, They wear beautiful, colorful garments. Oh, how the flowers are blossoming on these kadamba trees!

Their [respective] golden and dark complexions resemble lightning on a dark cloud. This sight fills my mind, and my eyes do not close.

Rādhā’s face is like the moon and Kṛṣṇa’s eyes, which are like those of a cakora bird, look toward Her. The vraja-gopīs’ prema is a rope binding Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.`
