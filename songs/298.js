  "verses": `tumi ta’ daẏāra sindhu,    adhama janāra bandhu,
more prabhu kara avadhāna
paṛ̌inu asat bhole,    kāma-timiṅgile gile,
ohe nātha kara paritrāṇa

ʝāvat janama mora,    aparādhe hainu bhora,
niṣkapaṭe nā bhajinu tomā
tathāpi ʝe tumi gati,    nā chāṛ̌iha prāṇapati,
mora sama nāhika adhamā

patita-pāvana nāma,    ghoṣaṇā tomāra śyāma,
upekhile nāhi mora gati
ʝadi hai aparādhī,    tathāpiha tumi gati,
satya satya ʝena satīra pati

tumi ta’ parama devā,    nāhi more upekhibā,
śuna śuna prāṇera īśvara
ʝadi kari aparādha,    tathāpiha tumi nātha,
sevā diẏā kara anucara

kāme mora hata cita,    nāhi śune nija hita,
manera nā ghuce durvāsanā
more nātha aṅgīkuru,    tumi vāñchā-kalpataru,
karuṇā dekhuka sarvajanā

mo-sama patita nāi,    tribhuvane dekha cāi,
‘narottama-pāvana’ nāma dhara
ghuṣuka saṁsāre nāma,    patita uddhāra’ śyāma,
nijadāsa kara giridhara

narottama baṛ̌a duḥkhī,    nātha more kara sukhī,
tomāra bhajana-saṅkīrtane
antarāẏa nāhi ʝāẏa,    ei se parama-bhaẏa,
nivedana kari anukṣaṇe`,

    "en": `O Lord, You are an ocean of mercy. You are the friend of the fallen souls. Please notice me. I have become like a non devotee, swallowed by the timingila fish of lust. O Lord, please protect me.

In every birth I repeatedly offended You. In every birth I failed to worship You sincerely. No one is as fallen as I. Nevertheless, You are the only goal of my life. O Lord of my life, please do not abandon me.

O Lord, You are known as Patita-pavana, the deliverer of the fallen, and You are also known as Syamasundara. Please do not ignore my appeal. Even if I am an offender, I think that You are the real goal of life. That is the truth.

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, please do not neglect me. O master of my life, please hear my words. Even if I have committed offences to You, I always think of You as my master. Please allow me to serve You as Your associate and follower.

Lust has destroyed my mind. I do not know what is actually beneficial for me. O Lord, You glance mercifully on all living entities and You are like a desire tree fulfilling the desires of everyone. Please accept me as Your servant.

O Lord, You will not see anyone in these three planetary systems who is as fallen as I. O Lord, please accept the name \"Narottama-pavana\" (the deliverer of Narottama), and let that name be broadcast throughout the material world. O Lord Syamasundara, O lifter of Govardhana Hill, O deliverer of the fallen, please accept me as Your servant.

Narottama dasa is very unhappy. O Lord please engage him in Your sankirtana movement and thus make him happy. O Lord, I am very afraid that I will not be able to overcome the many obstacles that stop me from advancing in devotional service. O Lord, at every moment I beg You to remove all those obstacles.`
