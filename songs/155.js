    "en": `Lord Nityananda is the root of bliss. Wild with the bliss of spiritual love, He staggers as He walks. He knows everything. He makes His brother-devotees wild with ecstati love, He chants \"Hari!\", and rolls on the ground.

(Refrain, Lord Nitai's form is filled with ecstati love for Lord Gaura. Seeing the faces of His brother-devotees, He staggers and falls. The rivers of His tears flood the earth.

Lord advaita is the root of spiritual bliss. Seeing the moon of Lored Nitai's face, Lord Advaita shouts in ecstasy. The hairs of His body stand erect. Again and again he chants, \"Hari! Haribol!\" Again and again he chants, \"Gaura! Gaura!\" He sings the glories of the dear devotees who are His personal associates.

To the earth He brought a flood of love from the spiritual world of Goloka. He brought a peerless, shoreless ocean of the nectar of spiritual love. Lord Nityananda and Lord Caitanya made the whole universe wild with the ecstasy of spiritual love. Ananta Raya begs for a drop of that ecstati love.`
