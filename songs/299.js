    "en": `O my Lord Madana Gopala! Govinda! Gopinatha! Be kind to this fallen soul! O Lord, I have fallen in the ocean of material life! Please tie me up with the rope of Your grace and take me along!

I am a fallen dog-eater, while You are the merciful Lord - so I have heard from the mouths of the Vaisnavas. I greatly hope that You will take me to Vrndavana, so that I can blissfully see Vamsi-vata.

Please take me forwards by pulling me by the hair. Oh Sri Yamuna! Give me the shade of your lotusfeet! For many days I have yearned for this - let me not be disappointed! Please do not play any tricks on me!

It is not certain when this temporary body will perish and bodily conscious people just think in terms of 'mine, mine'. Thus they are always afraid of death. Narottama dasa sings: \"My heart weeps day and night, afraid that I will then not attain Vraja.`
