    "en": `On the island of Godruma in the land of Nadīyā, the magnanimous personality Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu has opened a marketplace of the holy name for the benefit of all living beings.

[There, He calls out,] (“O persons of faith, O persons of faith!) On the order of Śrī Gaurāṅga, O brothers, I beg these alms from you: chant the names of Kṛṣṇa, worship Kṛṣṇa, and follow the instructions of Kṛṣṇa.

“Being free of offenses, chant the holy names of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is our mother, Kṛṣṇa is our father, and Kṛṣṇa is the treasure of our life.

“Give up all sinful behavior and live your life with Kṛṣṇa at the center. The essence of all forms of religion is to show compassion upon all living beings and chant the holy names of Krṣṇa.”`
